[活在未来，而不是当下](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAxNzI4MTMwMw==&mid=400682363&idx=1&sn=ef9bba3c02fcb1925e131bb302da1d5d#rd)

This is about the right direction of life. We all know that we should do right things instead of do things right, but the problems are most of us don't know what are the right things, or what is the right direction. No one can give you the answer, nor can this article. Xiaolai said that once he had seen his own future:

>28 岁的时候，我做出了一个艰难的、依然含混的，但却是主动的决定，那是我重生的起点，而后反复重生，都是幸亏有了那个决定。而我在很艰难的情况下死活要那么做的原因在于，我看到了自己的未来。理由很简单，逻辑也很简单，如果我所销售的东西是我自己做出来的，卖得越好，赚得越多的同时，我会越幸福。可现在卖的东西不是我自己做的，赚钱也很开心，但就是缺了点什么：
>
对，缺的是幸福。

Last week I listened to a podcast shared by Lao Liu, the found of *Du Ku*, he shared the experience of founding *Du Ku* about ten years ago and made a conclusion that the past ten years is his happiest decade in his life and he would not change this even let him become the king. So we need ask ourselves, what really makes us happy?

Sometimes I regrets making the decision of leaving my first company. It looks like a really good job compared to the other jobs I have done. But when I made my decision, I really saw my future too. That is a very small company, and I will meet a very strong ceiling above me. There is no much space for me to grow. I did not leave because of money, I left because of upward space. BTW: my bosses in the company did not like me too much then, which made me even more difficult to grow. Anyway, I missed a opportunity for deep accumulation in a specific area, but I get an unlimited chance to grow.

It is a good thing to live in this era which everything has been keeping changing in a speed which we can not image. But, one of my biggest flaws is that I am not extremely enthusiastic about the future. It looks like I am a conservative guy, which I am likely to deny. This is why I can not see the future clearly thus I can not make the right decision and have to waste my time.

>28岁的时候，我有个判断，在未来，创造的价值肯定比销售的价值更高，尤其是对我个人来说。所以我即便已经很擅长销售，我还是要暂时放弃它、不管它，我要让自己变成一个能创造的人。我笃信这个道理，于是就那么做了，随着时间的推移，正确的结果渐渐展现。那么也就是说，在我想明白并开始笃信的那一刻，我已经某种程度上“活在未来”了，只不过，我的未来需要时间证明，而我需要要用行动与耐心等待早已经决定的结果最终落实。

[活在未来（二）](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAxNzI4MTMwMw==&mid=400918989&idx=1&sn=bfa5ea8950a0702dd281a2f5ee908c39&scene=20#rd)

The suggestion is:

>花一点时间，想象一下几年之后的你，你希望到那个时候，你自己是什么样子？然后，倒推回来，提前按照那个标准学习、工作。

[你想“成为自己”吗？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMDgyMTA3Mg==&mid=402317780&idx=1&sn=47e9cb0d54037e712554f513943ef313&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d98abf9548e9339b0f8de98954fc4338144fd85ba1be94e774960e2468da2b549a8d674fcf81827316&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=R4PB4RsNCYDnUTS39dSdXizwsktN7lQeQ5VtbuCRi1gJRjhtgb17pWKEDw16NTjY)

To be yourself, this is a beautiful nonsense. To be different? For what? The only meaningful expression is to be special, but how? If you can be remembered by others when related to some specific area, that's it. To achieve this, you need to be the best in that specific area. So simple! For example when we talk about self-grow, we have to mention Xiaolai. Here are Xiaolai's suggestion:

>你要对那个属于未来的、不断改善、不断进步的自己充满好奇心。
>
未来的那个你是需要你想尽一切办法去“发现”的 —— 反正不是你现在这样。
>
如此这般，你就自然而然地没办法对现在的自己过分关注。
>
进而如此这般就能够明白，所有人看到的只不过是现在的你，他们的评价与看法，正确与否实际上都与未来的你并没有太大的关系，所以，何必在意呢？

[8年时间，投资数十亿美元，什么让iPhone疯狂赚钱](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=NzgzNTc1NTIx&mid=403504106&idx=2&sn=c76183d476ccd218b9ed6f11f6c31eab&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d9af96ec915627b3f08c4fdfa05a5d87582e232384a32ab20f4b7ae8c65a956f6d3ca4a45260b3829f&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=R4PB4RsNCYDnUTS39dSdXizwsktN7lQeQ5VtbuCRi1gJRjhtgb17pWKEDw16NTjY)

It is waste of time to do the easy thing:)

>所有这一切所围绕的核心人物就是斯洛基，这个现年51岁的以色列人在加入苹果之前曾为英特尔(Intel)和IBM公司工作。他体格结实，为人热情。他会说阿拉伯语、希伯来语和法语，英语带有轻微的口音。当谈到任何与苹果有关的话题时，他总是无一例外地用近乎打哑谜的方式来解答。当被问到iPhone越来越薄的设计时，他说：“难的东西就是好的，容易的东西就是浪费时间。”他在回答另一个问题时说：“苹果公司的设计师们都是艺术家，工程师们都是奇才。”只有在谈到宽泛的话题时，他才会略加阐释。他说：“当设计师说‘这个很难’时，我的经验法则是，如果不违背物理学原理，那就意味着虽然难做，但却可以做到。”

OK, now I understand that the A9 chip is designed by Apple, and the biggist phone chip provider is Qualcomm. Here is the competition.

>来自苹果的这些神秘半导体让科技业好奇不已，但直到2013年iPhone 5s推出之后，竞争对手才真正开始重视这些芯片。这款手机安装了A7处理器，这是第一款应用在智能手机上的64位芯片——处理能力是当时标准32位芯片的两倍。这项新技术使苹果支付Apple Pay和Touch ID指纹扫描仪等全新功能成为了可能。尽管研发人员要重写应用程序以适应这一新标准，但它为更流畅的地图、更酷的视频游戏和更灵敏且不会占用大量内存的应用软件扫清了道路。
>
作为当时，也是时下最大的手机芯片设计公司，高通做出了一个代价高昂的决定：放弃其32位芯片的研发，将全部资源投入到赶超苹果64位芯片的工作中。发布半导体设计详尽评估报告的网站AnandTech的总编瑞安•史密斯(Ryan Smith)称：“手机公司都想要闪闪发光的新玩意儿，A7真的颠覆了这个世界。”
>
在回忆起竞争对手对苹果64位芯片做出的惊人反应时，斯洛基控制不住脸上的笑意。他说：“当我们选定做某件事的时候，是因为我们认为这是一个没人能解决的问题，或者说这是一个独一无二、与众不同的想法，而最好的解决办法就是亲手去做。”

Johny Srouji has very interesting religious and ethnic background:

>斯洛基出生于以色列北部港口城市海法，在家中排行老三。他的家庭属于信仰基督教的阿拉伯人家庭，在以色列这样一个犹太教国家，这一群体是少数中的少数。“海法是以色列多元化族群融合得最好的城市之一，”他说，“这里有基督徒、有穆斯林、有犹太教徒，还有巴哈伊信徒，你能想到的任何一种宗教在这儿都能找到，而且所有人在一起生活得很融洽。融合对我一直很有帮助。”

Even more interesting educational background:

>斯洛基的父亲在海法城外开了一家制作金属模具的公司。从10岁起，斯洛基周末和暑假都会到公司里帮父亲制作用于发动机部件、医疗设备和其他机械设备成型的木模。他父亲有一套奇特的经营哲学：对于复杂的产品，他会向顾客低收费，对比较容易的产品则正相反。斯洛基说，“如果有什么非常复杂的产品他从没做过的，他就很想做。”

The job they do seems not so interesting if you focus on the detail:

>所有设备都是远程操作。那些盒子里运行的软件程序用于扫描芯片架构里可能存在的缺陷。一块芯片里每一个元件的测试过程都要持续好几天，一个元件测试完之后，接着进行下一个元件的测试，如此延续，直到所有元件测试完毕，整个过程长的时候可能需要几个月时间。“我们尽可能地反复测试这些芯片，”斯洛基说，“如果足够幸运和细致，在产品上市之前你就能发现其中的缺陷。”

There is still long way to go for Apple:

>苹果公司并不能完全掌控自己的命运。从很多方面来讲，它仍旧要受制于供应链。它的显示屏来自三星电子，蜂窝式调制解调器来自高通。三星和台积电(TSMC)仍在为它生产处理器。苹果公司能否满足市场需求，在一定程度上要取决于这些公司的生产能力。同时，在芯片开发的部分领域，苹果还落后于三星，比如在中央处理器上增加一只调制解调器，从而达到节省存储空间和耗电的性能，还有从20纳米制式的芯片设计向更紧凑的16纳米制式转变，从而实现在较小的空间里挤进更多传感器的效果。在硅谷科技咨询公司Linley Group担任移动芯片高级分析师的麦克•德姆勒(Mike Demler)说，“如果单从硬件角度来讲，不考虑苹果公司营销能力的话，我会说三星的处理器是最好的。”

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 1](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap4PLNVUWyBJtq706C4lGUaPoIfmVWtTspM)

Very impressive story of Cheryl, who had lost her vestibular apparatus thus was left without balance, regained it through artificial sensor through the tongue. I am just curious about the residual effect, which means the patient can keep the function even after she takes off the equipment. As we know, if a certain function works well, both the sensory apparatus and the according brain map need to be right. For the brain map, it is plastic, which means even one part is damaged, there is another part can take over. But for the sensory apparatus, which for balance here is in the inner ears, if it is damaged, how can one get the sensory input without the help of artificial equipment? For example, in another experiment which was also be done by Paul Bach-y-Rita, he used cameras to substitute the retinas for vision. But in the case of Cheryl, how can you explain the residual effect when the patient doesn't use anything to replace the impaired sensory part?

Maybe here is the point, so Cheryl simply use other input as the sensory source of balance.

>How a sensation enters the brain is not important to Bach-y-Rita. “When a blind man uses a cane, he sweeps it back and forth, and has only one point, the tip, feeding him information through the skin receptors in the hand. Yet this sweeping allows him to sort out where the doorjamb is, or the chair, or distinguish a foot when he hits it, because it will give a little. Then he uses this information to guide himself to the chair to sit down. Though his hand sensors are where he gets the information and where the cane ‘interfaces’ with him, what he subjectively perceives is not the cane’s pressure on his hand but the layout of the room: chairs, walls, feet, the three-dimensional space. The actual receptor surface in the hand becomes merely a relay for information, a data port. The receptor surface loses its identity in the process.”
>
Bach-y-Rita determined that skin and its touch receptors could substitute for a retina, because both the skin and the retina are two-dimensional sheets, covered with sensory receptors, that allow a “picture” to form on them.

What I am trying to do now is, changing my brain structure and to be exceptional. So I need to understand the brain structure first.

>This can happen because all our sense receptors translate different kinds of energy from the external world, no matter what the source, into electrical patterns that are sent down our nerves. These electrical patterns are the universal language “spoken” inside the brain—there are no visual images, sounds, smells, or feelings moving inside our neurons. Bach-y-Rita realized that the areas that process these electrical impulses are far more homogeneous than neuroscientists appreciated, a belief that was reinforced when the neuroscientist Vernon Mountcastle discovered that the visual, auditory, and sensory cortices all have a similar six-layer processing structure. To Bach-y-Rita, this meant that any part of the cortex should be able to process whatever electrical signals were sent to it, and that our brain modules were not so specialized after all.

And for this project, which will be amazing if succeed, maybe can make people reach orgasm without penis thus without woman (like masturbation? OK, I guess the point of this project is to let patient have normal sexual life with partner, instead of pursuing orgasm, although I can not imagine how they can reach oagasms if they have no feeling in their penises.)

>he even has a project for a condom that he hopes will allow spinal cord injury victims who have no feeling in their penises to have orgasms. It is based on the premise that sexual excitement, like other sensory experiences, is “in the brain,” so the sensations of sexual movement, picked up by sensors on the condom, can be translated into electrical impulses that can then be transmitted to the part of the brain that processes sexual excitement.

The most important part of this Chapter

>Traditional rehabilitation exercises typically ended after a few weeks, when a patient stopped improving, or “plateaued,” and doctors lost the motivation to continue. But Bach-y-Rita, based on his knowledge of nerve growth, began to argue that **these learning plateaus were temporary—part of a plasticity-based learning cycle—in which stages of learning are followed by periods of consolidation. Though there was no apparent progress in the consolidation stage, biological changes were happening internally, as new skills became more automatic and refined.**
