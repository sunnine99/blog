[The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64084.The_Attention_Revolution)

by B. Alan Wallace.

[2016读书笔记之《The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind》](../../../2016/05/19/reading.html)

The book has been cited in many literatures about meditation.

stage 1: direct attention

Simply focusing your attention on the sensations of the breath is direct attention, the first stage of practice.

stage 2: continuous attention

When you can occasionally maintain continuity of awareness of bodily sensations for about a minute, you have reached the second stage.

stage 3: resurgent attention

When you reach the third stage, your attentional stability has increased so that most of the time you remain engaged with the object.

initial emphasis in shamatha practice is on relaxation which can be induced by attending to the sensations of breathing throughout the body.

THe second emphasis is on stability of attention, and for this it can be helpful to observe the sensations of breathing in the region of the belly.

Then we shift the emphasis to cultivating vividness of attention. You do this by elevating the focus of attention and directing it to **subtler object**. Direct your attention to **the tactile sensations of your breath at the apertures of your nostrils** or above your upper lip, wherever you feel the in- and out-flow of your breath.
