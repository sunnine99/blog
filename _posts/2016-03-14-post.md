[让孩子上升到社会的“完美安全层”去](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NjM4NjU3Mg==&mid=403673250&idx=1&sn=cca4199b17721c6553d4723e3ce12113&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d9d3ca6e5d4b9e7cfae0c21f05135e04029d828f0f6825ccf8902cb7b0d591a7a8c7da0c6f48029def&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

Dr. Bing talked about the safety layer in this article, and mentioned three concept: financial free, geographic free and spiritual free. Most of us maybe are familiar with the first one, but not so familiar with the latter two, which are even more inspiring.

The geographic free means we can live wherever we like, so if there is some uncertainty in one country, we can easily move to another country which can give us more safety. This requires two things like Dr. Bing mentioned:

>1.语言能力 2 跨文化能力——也就是文化多元性和思想开放包容性。

And what is spiritual free, look at this:

>当你受过的教育、见过的世面、接触过的人、获得的经济收入、社会地位、公众认可、社会影响力等等等一切因素综合起来，**让你认为：你对世界的理解是客观的，你的见解是正确的，这一份对自己看法的深信不疑，坚持自己的逐渐和偏好，就是精神自由。**精神自由的反面，就是占大部分的，容易被洗脑，道德绑架，追潮流的人，他们毫无主见，随波逐流。

This is what we long for becoming exactly, it is a level high above our present spiritual level and we have a long way to get there.

**Concepts** are always the most important things when we read or learn something. Here we have two, great article. Why concepts are so important? When we have concepts, we have methodologies accordingly. For the geographic free, the methodlogy is that we must master at least English, even after we have financial free, because without this we will not get geographic free. For the spiritual free, OK, there are too much, think about them by yourself.

[为什么有的娃爱思考爱探索，有的呆若木鸡？想娃当前者？请做到以下几点...](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NjM4NjU3Mg==&mid=403708342&idx=1&sn=6af4260c5dc99e7e59c41dc2624086e1&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d918c3f0b4d360c753e2982a3b861048f6eba032581eeafa3fdac324b92f7cce0239c130e5700fb791&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

Another article from Dr. Bing: How to reply question from your child?

>也有很多家长对娃的回答有知无不言言无不尽的倾向。这种操作看似对孩子的支持和鼓励实则不利于孩子的全面成长。
>
我举一个的例子：大家知道上课中娃最常问的是什么问题吗？很简单“老师这道题怎么做？”基本是上课中最常遇见的提问了，但你会发现很少有老师直接回答的，如果真的学生问你什么，你就答什么，对娃的帮助极少，原因呢：缺少孩子的主动思考，缺少孩子自己探索的过程。所以老师要做的事情是引导，我们主张启发式教学正缘于此。
>
那么回到生活中，初为人父母缺少老师的丰富经验，就会出现为了鼓励娃而全部问题都回答的状况，正确的做法是什么呢？发动娃的主观能动性，利用孩子的好奇心，增长孩子自主思考和探索的能力。
>
一个简单的公式：
>
孩子能自己想出来的 \> 孩子自己看书得到的 \> 孩子与小朋友探讨出来 \> 父母直接回答的
>
所以娃问你为什么的时候：
>
父母的最好回答应该是“你真棒，这个问题都想到了！那么你能不能先说说你的看法呢？”先对娃的提问作出肯定和鼓励，然后询问娃的看法。这里要了解，我们询问不一定要得到娃的答案，只是需要娃有个自省的过程。
>
接下来可引导娃查阅相关书籍，或者引导娃与其它小伙伴讨论（这个不可控性较高，但对娃能力的提升是综合性的），最后父母给出较明确的回答。

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 6](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap63xUkRRw9ESbM82QxPVX8zFZ93CFhoE6g)

The last part of this chapter is very interesting, it is about a blind woman who can read the literature faster then the normal people with good visual ability. The explanation which the author gave here is also very enlightening:

>Emma’s blindness has reorganized her brain and her life. A number of us who were at the dinner are interested in literature, but since she has gone blind, Emma has done more reading than any of us. A computer program from Kurzweil Educational Systems reads books aloud to her in a monotone that pauses for commas, stops for periods, and rises in pitch for questions. This computer voice is so rapid, I cannot make out a single word. But Emma has gradually learned to listen at a faster and faster pace, so she is now reading at about 340 words a minute and is marching through all the great classics. “I get into an author, and I read everything he has ever written, and then I move on to another.” She has read Dostoyevsky (her favorite), Gogol, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dickens, Chesterton, Balzac, Hugo, Zola, Flaubert, Proust, Stendhal, and many others. Recently she read three Trollope novels in one day. She asked me how it might be possible for her to read so much more quickly than before she went blind. I theorized that her massive visual cortex, no longer processing sight, had been taken over for auditory processing.

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 8](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap5EiwqgwntO_6gUVx79LUIpQMZ5YbQYvhs)

This chapeter is really amazing part, that's why we need to be "slow". For the quickly learned stuff, neuron collections are **"easy-come, easy-go"**. Never be frustrated because you can not learn something quickly, because the more quickly you learn, the more quickly you forget. That is why we need patience to learn everything.

>Understanding this tortoise-and-hare effect can help us understand what we must do to truly master new skills. After a brief period of practice, as when we cram for a test, it is relatively easy to improve because we are likely strengthening existing synaptic connections. But we quickly forget what we’ve crammed—because these are easy-come, easy-go neuronal connections and are rapidly reversed. Maintaining improvement and making a skill permanent require the slow steady work that probably forms new connections. If a learner thinks he is making no cumulative progress, or feels his mind is “like a sieve,” he needs to keep at the skill until he gets “the Monday effect,” which in Braille readers took six months. The Friday-Monday difference is probably why some people, the “tortoises,” who seem slow to pick up a skill, may nevertheless learn it better than their “hare” friends—the “quick studies” who won’t necessarily hold on to what they have learned without the sustained practice that solidifies the learning.

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 9](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap7t8wV3poFCUqQPoSWfutUfpro4f87-4-Q)

Repetition forms long-term memories. Learning makes one of our genes turn on and make according protein (all the genes contain in each cell, but not all of them turn on).

I am very much curious why I am not suffering the trauma in my early childhood any longer, which brought me a lot of problems during my college period. Although I have not experienced very severe trauma from family but I did have very bad experience of being bullied. But it looks like I have completely turn the new page. How did I succeed to get rid of these bad influence from childhood? Did I deliberately choose to ignore them? Or I am just trying to avoid dwelling on the past?

Remember the book *Why Home Hurts* by Wu Zhihong, which introduces the concept of *primitive family*. But this is not the root of all those problems. This chapter's content reveals the deep cause of those problems, much better than the whole book of *Why Homes Hurts*. This chapter introduces a man whose mother died when he was 2 years old and became indifferent and unfaithful to his wife. There are many similiar stories in *Why Home Hurts* but none of them touches me so deeply. After the treatment of psychotherapy, the man became better and no longer remote. I guess this is one of the key point of my situation. People tend to be remote because of the defense mechanism, so they will push away everybody who are close to them. Although I had also been remote in some period of my adolescence, I eventually became quite open both for friendship and love. This is why I can walk out of the shadow of childhood. Like I said in [the book review of *Why Home Hurts*](https://sunnine99.github.io/blog//blog/2016/02/07/why_home_hurts.html), we all need to become open-minded and have the willpower to surpass the errors in the past.

>但是比原生家庭更重要的，是每个人愿不愿意让自己改变，走出自己童年的错误。很多案例里面，虽然某些人的问题更严重，但是他们认识到这一点并且有强烈的改变动机，他们可以让自己从阴影里走出来，享受一个正常的人生。而有些人虽然可能问题没那么严重，但是没有改变的动机，他们可能一辈子都要活在阴影中。

[别再用勤奋掩饰你的懒惰](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MjM5MDgzMDYyMA==&mid=423114319&idx=3&sn=edce15770631f4c12f99e3da11d98ec0&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d91f3d6b1f546a7ff5f2de4019800069a340410bcb4a269b5e3de19a79b86e04736401f9e50fb6777c&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

In one of my article [*You are not rich enough to fight the talent*](https://sunnine99.github.io/blog//blog/2016/02/12/rich_enough.html), I also mentioned that hard work needs right direction, as well as enough patience. However, I still need to remind myself everyday not to be stuck in superficial "hard work". I must keep reflecting on what is the really important thing.

>大部分人对勤奋的理解，都肤浅地停留在这种表面的仪式感上面，而忽视了勤奋的本质意义。更可怕的是一旦你习惯了这样的过程，便很容易从中得到满足，最后当发现自己没有得到应有的回报的时候开始怨天尤人，觉得天道不公。
>
什么是对勤奋肤浅的认识呢？
>
重复性的做一件事情，却缺乏思考。
>
长时间的做一件事情，却缺乏思考。
>
以上两种便是最为常见的勤奋误区，也是大部分勤奋却平庸者陷入发展困境的本质原因。

[如何高效地学习英文，快速达到能听会说的水平？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI4MzExMDU1Nw==&mid=402075616&idx=1&sn=ca4d8fa9e500c927a44b6c9daf57b082&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d9382b1573abf0efce3dbb636d3c18fb7e803a494b435316c918dfe42c0d726473c96c13d2206eff3a&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

Don't ignore the phonetic alphabet. I made almost the same mistake with Xiaolai (see below), now when I read English, I will look up each word which I am not 100% sure of its prononciation and listen to the right prononciation. In this way, I am trying to correct all the wrong prononciation in my brain. In many cases, I can understand a word when I read it, but I can not understand it when I hear it. Also I can not be understood when I use the wrong prononciation, that is a very big issue during the communication.  At present, my biggest confusion is the UK prononciation and US prononciation, sometimes they are quite different...

>李笑来老师就说过，自己有几万词汇量，发音和单词的形状对应不起来，几乎都是错的，所以花了很长时间一一把单词发音都矫正过来，这样听力能力才飞速提高，其实这样的弯路一开始是可以避免的，学到40多个发音，每次看到新的音标都能读对就可以了

[气质的力量——不但很华丽，还是孩子获取最大化社会资源的关键武器](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NjM4NjU3Mg==&mid=403966665&idx=1&sn=d8d9a886b196e5d87905d97ae0cc46a5&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d917e6c8070121d3e4bb122b3786c32eca81cd9cb4fe6b260ed7a162c7c2bad656dc69dab6f444727c&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

What is charisma? This article gives you some answer. What kind of parents can bring their children good charisma?

>最后要说基底气质。有些人，尤其是和我一样来自底层的人——因为早年长期的匮乏、敏感、自备，导致基底气质太差：畏缩，容易炸毛，计较——这些看上去是性格，其实举手投足反应在气质上，就算他们智商优良受了很好的教育，进了职场一样后继乏力。我觉得这和家长的气质很有关系。你们去年音乐会上见过我父母，**他们虽然没有受过教育，但他们从来都是心境平和豁达的，毫无贫民区常见的市井气，例如从来没有和邻居吵架，从来没说过粗话，喜欢读书，喜欢和我讨论**，表现上几乎和知识分子父母一样——这一点对我影响太大了，我非常感谢他们。

The protagonist of this article owns an outstanding talent, that's the best weapon he has to achieve his success in careel:

>是当我毕业成了一名见习律师后，才发现我对人有近乎上帝一样的洞察力：客户几乎不需要解释什么，我就能猜到他接下来想说的，真实深刻地理解他的需要；他们每一个细微的动作，我都能感知到这个背后的含义和可能触发的下一个动作（例如口渴，例如焦虑），这个天赋的结果就是：客户和我的沟通成本非常低，他们感到和我沟通由衷地舒服自在。不出两年，我就从同期的新人中脱颖而出——因为所有客人都喜欢找我。新人中有来自律师世家的，也有来自上层商业家庭自带客户源的，有比我更聪明更勤奋的，但是天赋却让我完胜。天赋是人的一件武器。
