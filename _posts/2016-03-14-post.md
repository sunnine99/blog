[让孩子上升到社会的“完美安全层”去](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NjM4NjU3Mg==&mid=403673250&idx=1&sn=cca4199b17721c6553d4723e3ce12113&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d9d3ca6e5d4b9e7cfae0c21f05135e04029d828f0f6825ccf8902cb7b0d591a7a8c7da0c6f48029def&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

Dr. Bing talked about the safety layer in this article, and mentioned three concept: financial free, geographic free and spiritual free. Most of us maybe are familiar with the first one, but not so familiar with the latter two, which are even more inspiring.

The geographic free means we can live wherever we like, so if there is some uncertainty in one country, we can easily move to another country which can give us more safety. This requires two things like Dr. Bing mentioned:

>1.语言能力 2 跨文化能力——也就是文化多元性和思想开放包容性。

And what is spiritual free, look at this:

>当你受过的教育、见过的世面、接触过的人、获得的经济收入、社会地位、公众认可、社会影响力等等等一切因素综合起来，**让你认为：你对世界的理解是客观的，你的见解是正确的，这一份对自己看法的深信不疑，坚持自己的逐渐和偏好，就是精神自由。**精神自由的反面，就是占大部分的，容易被洗脑，道德绑架，追潮流的人，他们毫无主见，随波逐流。

This is what we long for becoming exactly, it is a level high above our present spiritual level and we have a long way to get there.

**Concepts** are always the most important things when we read or learn something. Here we have two, great article. Why concepts are so important? When we have concepts, we have methodologies accordingly. For the geographic free, the methodlogy is that we must master at least English, even after we have financial free, because without this we will not get geographic free. For the spiritual free, OK, there are too much, think about them by yourself.

[为什么有的娃爱思考爱探索，有的呆若木鸡？想娃当前者？请做到以下几点...](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NjM4NjU3Mg==&mid=403708342&idx=1&sn=6af4260c5dc99e7e59c41dc2624086e1&scene=0&key=710a5d99946419d918c3f0b4d360c753e2982a3b861048f6eba032581eeafa3fdac324b92f7cce0239c130e5700fb791&ascene=0&uin=NDUzMjgxNDM1&devicetype=iMac14%2C3+OSX+OSX+10.9.5+build(13F1603)&version=11020201&pass_ticket=l9LXtmXyXDJPBHhdDTjNMJJhgefNKka1dX%2F8RW%2Fh2UGEK4qPMcyAVRmXVVpqNVv2)

Another article from Dr. Bing: How to reply question from your child?

>也有很多家长对娃的回答有知无不言言无不尽的倾向。这种操作看似对孩子的支持和鼓励实则不利于孩子的全面成长。
>
我举一个的例子：大家知道上课中娃最常问的是什么问题吗？很简单“老师这道题怎么做？”基本是上课中最常遇见的提问了，但你会发现很少有老师直接回答的，如果真的学生问你什么，你就答什么，对娃的帮助极少，原因呢：缺少孩子的主动思考，缺少孩子自己探索的过程。所以老师要做的事情是引导，我们主张启发式教学正缘于此。
>
那么回到生活中，初为人父母缺少老师的丰富经验，就会出现为了鼓励娃而全部问题都回答的状况，正确的做法是什么呢？发动娃的主观能动性，利用孩子的好奇心，增长孩子自主思考和探索的能力。
>
一个简单的公式：
>
孩子能自己想出来的 \> 孩子自己看书得到的 \> 孩子与小朋友探讨出来 \> 父母直接回答的
>
所以娃问你为什么的时候：
>
父母的最好回答应该是“你真棒，这个问题都想到了！那么你能不能先说说你的看法呢？”先对娃的提问作出肯定和鼓励，然后询问娃的看法。这里要了解，我们询问不一定要得到娃的答案，只是需要娃有个自省的过程。
>
接下来可引导娃查阅相关书籍，或者引导娃与其它小伙伴讨论（这个不可控性较高，但对娃能力的提升是综合性的），最后父母给出较明确的回答。

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 6](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap63xUkRRw9ESbM82QxPVX8zFZ93CFhoE6g)

The last part of this chapter is very interesting, it is about a blind woman who can read the literature faster then the normal people with good visual ability. The explanation which the author gave here is also very enlightening:

>Emma’s blindness has reorganized her brain and her life. A number of us who were at the dinner are interested in literature, but since she has gone blind, Emma has done more reading than any of us. A computer program from Kurzweil Educational Systems reads books aloud to her in a monotone that pauses for commas, stops for periods, and rises in pitch for questions. This computer voice is so rapid, I cannot make out a single word. But Emma has gradually learned to listen at a faster and faster pace, so she is now reading at about 340 words a minute and is marching through all the great classics. “I get into an author, and I read everything he has ever written, and then I move on to another.” She has read Dostoyevsky (her favorite), Gogol, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Dickens, Chesterton, Balzac, Hugo, Zola, Flaubert, Proust, Stendhal, and many others. Recently she read three Trollope novels in one day. She asked me how it might be possible for her to read so much more quickly than before she went blind. I theorized that her massive visual cortex, no longer processing sight, had been taken over for auditory processing.

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 8](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap5EiwqgwntO_6gUVx79LUIpQMZ5YbQYvhs)

This chapeter is really amazing part, that's why we need to be "slow". For the quickly learned stuff, neuron collections are **"easy-come, easy-go"**. Never be frustrated because you can not learn something quickly, because the more quickly you learn, the more quickly you forget. That is why we need patience to learn everything.

>Understanding this tortoise-and-hare effect can help us understand what we must do to truly master new skills. After a brief period of practice, as when we cram for a test, it is relatively easy to improve because we are likely strengthening existing synaptic connections. But we quickly forget what we’ve crammed—because these are easy-come, easy-go neuronal connections and are rapidly reversed. Maintaining improvement and making a skill permanent require the slow steady work that probably forms new connections. If a learner thinks he is making no cumulative progress, or feels his mind is “like a sieve,” he needs to keep at the skill until he gets “the Monday effect,” which in Braille readers took six months. The Friday-Monday difference is probably why some people, the “tortoises,” who seem slow to pick up a skill, may nevertheless learn it better than their “hare” friends—the “quick studies” who won’t necessarily hold on to what they have learned without the sustained practice that solidifies the learning.

[The Brain that Changes Itself, Chapter 9](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap7t8wV3poFCUqQPoSWfutUfpro4f87-4-Q)

Repetition forms long-term memories. Learning makes one of our genes turn on and make according protein (all the genes contain in each cell, but not all of them turn on).

I am very much curious why I am not suffering the trauma in my early childhood any longer, which brought me a lot of problems during my college period. Although I have not experienced very severe trauma from family but I did have very bad experience of being bullied. But it looks like I have completely turn the new page. How did I succeed to get rid of these bad influence from childhood? Did I deliberately choose to ignore them? Or I am just trying to avoid dwelling on the past?

Remember the book *Why Home Hurts* by Wu Zhihong, which introduces the concept of *primitive family*. But this is not the root of all those problems. This chapter's content reveals the deep cause of those problems, much better than the whole book of *Why Homes Hurts*. This chapter introduces a man whose mother died when he was 2 years old and became indifferent and unfaithful to his wife. There are many similiar stories in *Why Home Hurts* but none of them touches me so deeply. After the treatment of psychotherapy, the man became better and no longer remote. I guess this is one of the key point of my situation. People tend to be remote because of the defense mechanism, so they will push away everybody who are close to them. Although I had also been remote in some period of my adolescence, I eventually became quite open both for friendship and love. This is why I can walk out of the shadow of childhood. Like I said in [the book review of *Why Home Hurts*](https://sunnine99.github.io/blog//blog/2016/02/07/why_home_hurts.html), we all need to become open-minded and have the willpower to surpass the errors in the past.

>但是比原生家庭更重要的，是每个人愿不愿意让自己改变，走出自己童年的错误。很多案例里面，虽然某些人的问题更严重，但是他们认识到这一点并且有强烈的改变动机，他们可以让自己从阴影里走出来，享受一个正常的人生。而有些人虽然可能问题没那么严重，但是没有改变的动机，他们可能一辈子都要活在阴影中。

In one of my article [*You are not rich enough to fight the talent*](https://sunnine99.github.io/blog//blog/2016/02/12/rich_enough.html), I also mentioned that hard work needs right direction, as well as enough patience. However, I still need to remind myself everyday not to be stuck in superficial "hard work". I must keep reflecting on what is the really important thing.

>大部分人对勤奋的理解，都肤浅地停留在这种表面的仪式感上面，而忽视了勤奋的本质意义。更可怕的是一旦你习惯了这样的过程，便很容易从中得到满足，最后当发现自己没有得到应有的回报的时候开始怨天尤人，觉得天道不公。

什么是对勤奋肤浅的认识呢？

重复性的做一件事情，却缺乏思考。

长时间的做一件事情，却缺乏思考。

以上两种便是最为常见的勤奋误区，也是大部分勤奋却平庸者陷入发展困境的本质原因。

Don't ignore the phonetic alphabet. I made almost the same mistake with Xiaolai (see below), now when I read English, I will look up each word which I am not 100% sure of its prononciation and listen to the right prononciation. In this way, I am trying to correct all the wrong prononciation in my brain. In many cases, I can understand a word when I read it, but I can not understand it when I hear it. Also I can not be understood when I use the wrong prononciation, that is a very big issue during the communication.  At present, my biggest confusion is the UK prononciation and US prononciation, sometimes they are quite different...

>李笑来老师就说过，自己有几万词汇量，发音和单词的形状对应不起来，几乎都是错的，所以花了很长时间一一把单词发音都矫正过来，这样听力能力才飞速提高，其实这样的弯路一开始是可以避免的，学到40多个发音，每次看到新的音标都能读对就可以了

What is charisma? This article gives you some answer. What kind of parents can bring their children good charisma?

>最后要说基底气质。有些人，尤其是和我一样来自底层的人——因为早年长期的匮乏、敏感、自备，导致基底气质太差：畏缩，容易炸毛，计较——这些看上去是性格，其实举手投足反应在气质上，就算他们智商优良受了很好的教育，进了职场一样后继乏力。我觉得这和家长的气质很有关系。你们去年音乐会上见过我父母，**他们虽然没有受过教育，但他们从来都是心境平和豁达的，毫无贫民区常见的市井气，例如从来没有和邻居吵架，从来没说过粗话，喜欢读书，喜欢和我讨论**，表现上几乎和知识分子父母一样——这一点对我影响太大了，我非常感谢他们。

The protagonist of this article owns an outstanding talent, that's the best weapon he has to achieve his success in careel:

>是当我毕业成了一名见习律师后，才发现我对人有近乎上帝一样的洞察力：客户几乎不需要解释什么，我就能猜到他接下来想说的，真实深刻地理解他的需要；他们每一个细微的动作，我都能感知到这个背后的含义和可能触发的下一个动作（例如口渴，例如焦虑），这个天赋的结果就是：客户和我的沟通成本非常低，他们感到和我沟通由衷地舒服自在。不出两年，我就从同期的新人中脱颖而出——因为所有客人都喜欢找我。新人中有来自律师世家的，也有来自上层商业家庭自带客户源的，有比我更聪明更勤奋的，但是天赋却让我完胜。天赋是人的一件武器。

The original article I shared in my momentum was deleted. I searched it in google and found this link. This is a very interesting article, especially about Chinese traditional medicine. From a point of view of doctor with western medicine:

>中医也帮助姥姥加深了对中西医关系的理解。刚考过执照时候，姥姥认为中医的疗效都是心理作用，只有西医才真正能治病。但时间久了，姥姥发现她新学的中医学问帮她形成了一个特长，就是用中药调理有不孕不育问题的夫妻，尤其在试管婴儿和保胎方面，这改变了她对中医的看法。在美国，做一次试管婴儿很贵，但成功率没有把握。姥姥列了一个方子，吃完她的草药，病号的成功效率会提高。按姥姥的估计，在20年的过程中，她看了差不多500个不孕不育的病例，其中300多最终生了小孩子。其中除了几对日本人和洋人，几乎全部是华人。

New concept: Deep Thinking? It is not necessary to emphasize why we need deep thinking, the key point is how? There are some suggestions about how we can think deeply in this article.

1) repetition. There is a good example:

>针对问题多思、多想，思、想，思、想不动脑哪来的思想。李小龙曾经也说明过这个问题，他说不怕一个人会100种功夫，只怕一个人把一个招式练100遍。

2) write down your thoughts and share them with others.

Why are there so many articles about this topic: "avoid useless hard work"? Deep thinking is more important, right direction is more important, and so on. Anyway, in this article, it is the business sense that is emphasized.

One key point is mentioned in TTP (the tripe package): the insecurity, or chip on the shoulder to prove oneself. If this can be combined with the other two factors in TTP: superiority and self-discipline, it will bring us great success.

Another important thing is mentioned in *Why Home Hurts*: never let your safety based on only one thing, it will be extremely dangerous if this only pillar fails. If we think about this according to the principle, we should put more emphasis on the other important factors for future success. We don't necessarily have to compete with others in the academic field.

>你什么都不用管了，就好好学习，好好学习就好，别的东西都没用。这是一个很多家长都在实践的做法。这种观点会将孩子的自恋性体验全部集中在获得好成绩这一点上。这会造成很多认知偏差。大家可以联想一下现在身边的“成功人生案例”（排除拼爹的），那些实现个人理想的人未必都是曾经成绩最好的学生。成就这种东西可以由很多东西构成：交往能力、对生活的热爱、创意、艺术性、谈吐、气质、颜值

[亚裔在美国的尴尬处境](http://www.ftchinese.com/story/001066544?page=rest)

The content below looks quite familiar, we argued this once when we were in Africa last year. This kind of social issue is far more complicated than we can image. It is not just simply wrong or right.

>拿亚裔人的优秀来否定种族歧视的存在、批评其他少数族裔懒惰，本身就是白人主导的社会转移矛盾的手段。“模范少数族裔”这个说法由白人在民权运动高潮的1960年代提出，他们认为少数族裔争取平等权利是他们太贪婪，因为亚裔从没说要争取什么，好像也过得很好。最早提出“模范少数族裔”概念的《美国新闻与世界报道》（U.S News & World Report），[在1966年的文章](http://depts.washington.edu/college/mce/Myth1.pdf)写道，“在有人提出花上千亿帮助黑鬼和其他少数族裔的今天，这个国家的30万华裔却在没有其他人帮助的情况下自己努力，跑到了前面。”这种言论的唯一目的就是巩固特权阶级的统治，因为仅仅二十年后，当亚裔收入开始超过白人收入的时候，主流媒体又改变了论调。《财富》（Fortune）杂志1982年的一篇文章写道，“（亚裔的）高收入比他们实际应得的要多。”由此可见，所谓“模范少数族裔”的赞美根本上是为了否定所有少数族裔为平权所做的正当努力，它让亚裔和其他少数族裔站在平权问题的对立面，制造了各族群间的关系紧张。

Interesting point of view, now I know a new branch of psychology: [narrative psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_psychology).

>Narrative psychology is a viewpoint or a stance within psychology concerned with the "storied nature of human conduct", or in other words how human beings deal with experience by constructing stories and listening to the stories of others.

There are two sides about the way of narrating our stories. First, we have our own ways to tell our stories, this is part of our personality.

>心理学家认为，一个人的人生故事并不是流水账式的传记，而是将那些事件、事实打散和分类，在脑海中重新“编码”、整合，从而形成的有意义的故事——我们的人生故事，是由自己叙述出来的。
>
我们的一生中都会发生不计其数的事实，而在叙述“我”的人生故事时，我会选择哪些事件来作为素材？我用什么样的方式来讲述这些事件？我如何排列这些事件的重要程度？我会怎样理解这些事件中的因果关系？这些都能够反映出“我”是什么样的人，它们是我们人格中一个重要的组成层面。

Second, this way of telling story, however, vice versa, makes us to become us.

>同时，讲故事的过程也塑造了“我”。叙事心理学认为，我们的一生就是一个不断追求自我身份（self-identity）的过程，而叙事则是找到自我身份的一种关键方式。在讲故事的过程中，我们对一系列的生命事件进行了“自传式的因果推论”（autobiographical reasoning）。
>
举例来说，两个人可能遭遇一样的挫折，恋爱被拒、考试失利、工作不顺，但他们在讲述这些事件时的方式可能很不同。一个人可能会把这些事情讲述成一时的不顺，归因于外部的不幸运的因素；另一个人则可能把这些事讲述成自己的宿命，归因于自身某些气质和特质。这两种不同的叙事方式，本身就是这两个人不同的人格特质的一部分，同时也会不断塑造他们未来的经历。

Why are this so important?

>读到这里，你可能会问，在我们内心和口中所讲述的，真的是故事的真相吗？它会在多大程度上还原，或者曲解事情的本来面貌呢？然而，在叙事心理学家那里，故事是否反映出事实已经不再重要。“你的人生故事从来都不是事实的复刻。重要的是人们是否能够从过去发生的事情当中，获得意义和一致性。任何叙事都会包括一点谎言，但有些谎言已经包含了足够的真实。”犹他大学的发展心理学教授 Pasupathi 说。
>
事实上，我们组织和叙述过去事件的方式，不仅仅是理解自己的一种方式，也是预测未来的方式，就像文学作品中总会有铺垫、伏笔，Pasupathi 说，我们总是想通过对未来的预测，来消除未来的不确定造成的不安全感，因此，我们会努力用过去的碎片来组成未来的形状。

OK, the most important part need to be noted down:

[The Brain that Changes Itself, chapter 10](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap74TlRqALNK7ZWPxFSdeJ9g89Dz6Eg3Y7E)

An 90-years-old man who like novel things and keep his mind as sharp as young man. Also he has great attitude for life, which I should really learn from him. I really need to understand the randomness.

>His philosophical attitude also protects his brain because he doesn’t get worked up about little things—no small matter, since stress releases glucocorticoids, which can kill cells in the hippocampus.
>
“You seem less anxious and nervous than most people,” I say.
>
“I’ve seen it to be very beneficial for people.”
>
“Are you an optimistic person?”
>
“Not so much, but I think I understand what random events are. There are many things that go on that can affect me that are beyond my control. I can’t control them, only how I react to them. I’ve spent my time worrying about things I can control and can affect the outcome of, and I’ve managed to develop a philosophy that enables me to deal with those.”

I am just thinking about why meditation can be beneficial to our brain, maybe here is some answer, it is all about oxygen!

>Physical activity is helpful not only because it creates new neurons but because the mind is based in the brain, and the brain needs oxygen.

About meditation, here is some direct description.

>It also has a meditative aspect, which has been proven very effective in lowering stress and so is likely to preserve memory and the hippocampal neurons.

If the lack of vision can result in compensated super hearing ability, that means the reason why we can not see or hear very weak signals is because our brain are not powerful enough instead that our eyes or ears are not sensitive enough. Or just because our brain has a filter to protect us from too much signals.

>This hyperdevelopment of hearing, so common in the totally blind, is another sign of the brain’s ability to adjust to a changed situation. But this sensitivity has a cost. In traffic, when a horn blares, she puts her hands over her ears, to avoid sensory overload. At church she escapes the sound of the organ pipes by slipping out the door. School fire drills frightened her because of the noise and confusion.
>
She is also supersensitive to touch. Carol cuts the tags off Michelle’s clothing so she won’t feel them. It’s as though her brain lacks a filter to keep out excess sensation, so Carol often “filters” for her, protecting her. If Michelle has a second hemisphere, it is her mother.
