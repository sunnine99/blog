刚看完part 1，作者本来讨论的东西先不说，作者在书中流露出来的工作观就很颠覆，来看一下真正的聪明人是怎么看待工作和挣钱的。

work hard不等于think hard

>Trading forces someone to think hard; those who merely work hard generally lose their focus and intellectual energy. In addition, they end up drowning in randomness; work ethics, Nero believes, draw people to focus on noise rather than the signal.

关于牙医和歌星

>Arguably, in expectation, a dentist is considerably richer than the rock musician who is driven in a pink Rolls Royce, the speculator who bids up the price of impressionist paintings, or the entrepreneur who collects private jets. For one cannot consider a profession without taking into account the average of the people who enter it, not the sample of those who have succeeded in it.
>
the public observes the external signs of wealth without even having a glimpse at the source.

关于数学

>Mathematics is not just a “numbers game,” it is a way of thinking.

关于读了PHD却又放弃做科研

>Particularly thoughtful are those who had to abandon scientific studies because of their inability to keep focused on a narrowly defined problem.

勿以成败论英雄

>Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost.

关于常识

>common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age eighteen.

一个人不可能一辈子都靠运气

>The lucky fool might have benefited from some luck in life; over the longer run he would slowly converge to the state of a less-lucky idiot. Each one would revert to his long-term properties.

关于拥有财富的心态

>Following the incident, John regarded himself “ruined”; yet his net worth is still close to $1 million, which could be the envy of more than 99.9% of the inhabitants of our planet. Yet there is a difference between a wealth level reached from above and a wealth reached from below. The road from $16 million to $1 million is not as pleasant as the one from 0 to $1 million.

因为概率分布函数的不对称性，期望值(expectation)不等于中值(medium)

>As we saw in the last chapter, markets (and life) are not simple win/lose types of situations, as the cost of the losses can be markedly different from that of the wins. Maximizing the probability of winning does not lead to maximizing the expectation from the game when one’s strategy may include skewness, i.e., a small chance of large loss and a large chance of a small win.

关于读书

>in spite of my being a voracious reader, I have rarely been truly affected in my behavior (in any durable manner) by anything I have read. A book can make a strong impression, but such an impression tends to wane after some newer impression replaces it in my brain (a new book). I have to discover things by myself (recall the “Stove Is Hot” section in Chapter 3). These self-discoveries last.

挣钱的目的！树立正确的金钱观！顺带讽刺一下努力工作是能力平庸。这段话我应该打印出来贴在床头或者镜子上，天天起床时就读一遍！

>I suddenly felt financially insecure and feared becoming an employee of some firm that would turn me into a corporate slave with “work ethics” (whenever I hear work ethics I interpret inefficient mediocrity). I needed the backing of my bank account so I could buy time to think and enjoy life.

关于科学

>Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.

人类之所以喜欢总结规律，是为了方便记忆！

>Induction is going from plenty of particulars to the general. It is very handy, as the general takes much less room in one’s memory than a collection of particulars.

关于资本主义，不需要讲道德。有钱既不是美德也不是罪过，跟道德无关。

>The virtue of capitalism is that society can take advantage of people’s greed rather than their benevolence, but there is no need to, in addition, extol such greed as a moral (or intellectual) accomplishment (the reader can easily see that, aside from very few exceptions like George Soros, I am not impressed by people with money). Becoming rich is not directly a moral achievement, but that is not where the severe flaw in the book lies.

经常有人把乐观作为成功者的一个特性，这是因为幸存者偏差，因为乐观者低估了风险，更倾向于冒险（赌博），所以要么很成功在世人面前展现成功者的乐观，要么就惨败被世人所遗忘。所以乐观的人起伏更大而已。

>Optimism, it is said, is predictive of success. Predictive? It can also be predictive of failure. Optimistic people certainly take more risks as they are overconfident about the odds; those who win show up among the rich and famous, others fail and disappear from the analyses. Sadly.

在trading的世界里，只需要学会如何买进和卖出，这比炒鸡蛋还容易

>He has what he claims is a good track record. All I can infer is that he has learned to buy and sell. And it is harder to fry an egg than buy and sell.

而赚钱赔钱很可能完全靠运气，基本啥都不会，随机投资，赚钱赔钱概率跟扔硬币一样，各50%，那么如果有10000个投资经理在纯凭运气投资，也会有313个人会连续五年赚钱（50%的五次方），所以以前的record其实也说明不了问题，这更多的取决于总样本数量而已。但总会有人去总结这些靠运气的“成功者”的特性，还说得像模像样的。

>Meanwhile if we throw one of these successful traders into the real world we would get very interesting and helpful comments on his remarkable style, his incisive mind, and the influences that helped him achieve such success. Some analysts may attribute his achievement to precise elements among his childhood experiences. His biographer will dwell on the wonderful role models provided by his parents; we would be supplied with black-and-white pictures in the middle of the book of a great mind in the making. And the following year, should he stop outperforming (recall that his odds of having a good year have stayed at 50%) they would start laying blame, finding fault with the relaxation in his work ethics, or his dissipated lifestyle. They will find something he did before when he was successful that he has subsequently stopped doing, and attribute his failure to that. The truth will be, however, that he simply ran out of luck.

所以，判断一个投资者的水平不能光看他的record，更大程度取决于总样本数量。

>Recall that the survivorship bias depends on the size of the initial population. The information that a person derived some profits in the past, just by itself, is neither meaningful nor relevant. We need to know the size of the population from which he came. In other words, without knowing how many managers out there have tried and failed, we will not be able to assess the validity of the track record. If the initial population includes ten managers, then I would give the performer half my savings without a blink. If the initial population is composed of 10,000 managers, I would ignore the results. The latter situation is generally the case; these days so many people have been drawn to the financial markets. Many college graduates are trading as a first career, failing, then going to dental school.

关于非线性

>Our emotional apparatus is designed for linear causality. For instance, you study every day and learn something in proportion to your studies. If you do not feel that you are going anywhere, your emotions will cause you to become demoralized. But reality rarely gives us the privilege of a satisfying linear positive progression: You may study for a year and learn nothing, then, unless you are disheartened by the empty results and give up, something will come to you in a flash.

这是为什么那么多人坚持不到最后就放弃的原因，我要做的就是go the extra mile

>This summarizes why there are routes to success that are nonrandom, but few, very few, people have the mental stamina to follow them. Those who go the extra mile are rewarded.

非线性导致两极分化，但其实都不好

>Too much success is the enemy (think of the punishment meted out on the rich and famous); too much failure is demoralizing. I would like the option of having neither.

关于emotion（brain和heart）

>I am just intelligent enough to understand that I have a predisposition to be fooled by randomness—and to accept the fact that I am rather emotional. I am dominated by my emotions—but as an aesthete, I am happy about that fact. I am just like every single character whom I ridiculed in this book. Not only that, but I may be even worse than them because there may be a negative correlation between beliefs and behavior (recall Popper the man). The difference between me and those I ridicule is that I try to be aware of it. No matter how long I study and try to understand probability, my emotions will respond to a different set of calculations, those that my unintelligent genes want me to handle. If my brain can tell the difference between noise and signal, my heart cannot.

有些东西是天性，不要苛责自己，不如换一个角度看待

>We are designed to respond to hostility with hostility. I have enough enemies to add some spice to my life, but I sometimes wish I had a few more (I rarely go to the movies and need the entertainment). Life would be unbearably bland if we had no enemies on whom to waste efforts and energy.

维特因斯坦根的尺子：如何看待别人的评价

>Unless the source of the statement has extremely high qualifications, the statement will be more revealing of the author than the information intended by him. This applies, of course, to matters of judgment. A book review, good or bad, can be far more descriptive of the reviewer than informational about the book itself. This mechanism I also call Wittgenstein’s ruler: Unless you have confidence in the ruler’s reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler. The less you trust the ruler‘s reliability (in probability called the prior),the more information you are getting about the ruler and the less about the table.
>
The point carries practical implications: The information from an anonymous reader on Amazon.com is all about the person, while that of a qualified person, is going to be all about the book.

chap 12

牛人之所以牛？这也是hindsight bias？

>Then, in my twenties, I lived in a book-choked (but otherwise rather bare) apartment on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. The bareness was not ideological; it was simply because I never managed to enter a furniture store, as I would eventually stop at a bookstore along the way and haul bags of books instead. As can be expected, the kitchen was devoid of any form of food and utensils, save for a defective espresso machine, as I learned to cook only very recently (even then . . .).

每个人都有迷信的时候……

>On the one hand, I talked like someone with strong scientific standards, a probabilist focused on his craft. On the other, I had closed superstitions just like one of these blue-collar pit traders.

而这似乎是生物的本能？（书中提到的鸽子实验）

>This problem has a more worrying extension; we are not made to view things as independent from each other. When viewing two events A and B, it is hard not to assume that A causes B, B causes A, or both cause each other. Our bias is immediately to establish a causal link.

世界思想史？中世纪的时候阿拉伯文化还是很强大的，相比同时期还在基督教教条主义中挣扎的西方世界。

>Until the Mediterranean basin was dominated with monotheism, which led to the belief in some form of uniqueness of the truth (to be superceded later by episodes of communism), skepticism had gained currency among many major thinkers—and certainly permeated the world. The Romans did not have a religion per se; they were too tolerant to accept a given truth. Theirs was a collection of a variety of flexible and syncretic superstitions. I will not get too theological, except to say that we had to wait for a dozen centuries in the Western world to espouse critical thinking again. Indeed, for some strange reason during the Middle Ages, Arabs were critical thinkers (through their postclassical philosophical tradition) when Christian thought was dogmatic; then, after the Renaissance, the roles mysteriously reversed.

如何理解自相矛盾这件事：self-critical

>This may be a reason for us, who have learned from Popper how to remain self-critical, to respect him more, as he did not hew stubbornly to an opinion for the mere fact that he had voiced it in the past. Indeed your average literature professor would fault him for his contradictions and his change of mind.

作为trader的正确态度

>They spent their energy defending themselves rather than trying to make a buck with what they learned. Again, compare them with Soros, who walks around telling whoever has the patience to listen to him that he is fallible. My lesson from Soros is to start every meeting at my boutique by convincing everyone that we are a bunch of idiots who know nothing and are mistake-prone, but happen to be endowed with the rare privilege of knowing it.

面对randomness时的生活态度

>Recall that epic heroes were judged by their actions, not by the results. No matter how sophisticated our choices, how good we are at dominating the odds, randomness will have the last word. We are left only with dignity as a solution—dignity defined as the execution of a protocol of behavior that does not depend on the immediate circumstance. It may not be the optimal one, but it certainly is the one that makes us feel best. Grace under pressure, for example. Or in deciding not to toady up to someone, whatever the reward. Or in fighting a duel to save face. Or in signaling to a prospective mate during courtship: “Listen, I have a crush on you; I am obsessed with you, but I will not do a thing to compromise my dignity. Accordingly, the slightest snub and you will never see me again.”

书最后一段的建议

>Dress at your best on your execution day (shave carefully); try to leave a good impression on the death squad by standing erect and proud. Try not to play victim when diagnosed with cancer (hide it from others and only share the information with the doctor—it will avert the platitudes and nobody will treat you like a victim worthy of their pity; in addition, the dignified attitude will make both defeat and victory feel equally heroic). Be extremely courteous to your assistant when you lose money (instead of taking it out on him as many of the traders whom I scorn routinely do). Try not to blame others for your fate, even if they deserve blame. Never exhibit any self-pity, even if your significant other bolts with the handsome ski instructor or the younger aspiring model. Do not complain. If you suffer from a benign version of the “attitude problem,” like one of my childhood friends, do not start playing nice guy if your business dries up (he sent a heroic e-mail to his colleagues informing them “less business, but same attitude”). The only article Lady Fortuna has no control over is your behavior. Good luck.

后记

位置低的人依靠技能，因为所做的事是可重复，可以马上看到结果的，而位置越高的人，越容易依靠运气。

>Now take a peek inside the chief executive suite. Clearly, the decisions there are not repeatable. CEOs take a small number of large decisions, more like the person walking into the casino with a single million-dollar bet. External factors, such as the environment, play a considerably larger role than with the cook. The link between the skill of the CEO and the results of the company are tenuous.

CEO最需要的技能是PowerPoint

>More appropriately, what they have is skill in getting promoted within a company rather than pure skills in making optimal decisions—we call that “corporate political skill.” These are people mostly trained at using PowerPoint presentations.

两个事件的关联性有时候真的很难说

>The central banker lowers interest rates, a recovery ensues, but we do not know whether he caused it or if he slowed it down. We can’t even know that he didn’t destabilize the economy by increasing the risk of future inflation.

我们到底想要什么样的生活？

>I came to this conclusion when, about a decade ago, I stopped using an alarm clock. I still woke up around the same time, but I followed my own personal clock. A dozen minutes of fuzziness and variability in my schedule made a considerable difference. True, there are some activities that require such dependability that an alarm clock is necessary, but I am free to choose a profession where I am not a slave to external pressure. Living like this, one can also go to bed early and not optimize one’s schedule by squeezing every minute out of one’s evening. At the limit, you can decide whether to be (relatively) poor, but free of your time, or rich but as dependent as a slave.

最后的总结（第二版才有）

>It took me an entire lifetime to find out what my generator is. It is: We favor the visible, the embedded, the personal, the narrated, and the tangible; we scorn the abstract. Everything good (aesthetics, ethics) and wrong (Fooled by Randomness) with us seems to flow from it.

2017年的第一本书花了一个月终于读完了。这是一本很挑战三观的书，有很多东西值得去认真体会。这就是读一本层次远在你之上的作者写的书的好处，随随便便拿出一点东西都能让自己受益匪浅。最近发现一个趋势，估计是被微信公众号的赚钱模式给刺激的，稍微会写点东西的人都在拼命写，各种文章充斥着你的眼球，标题一个比一个有吸引力，彷佛少看了一篇会是人生的重大损失。在这个全民写作的时代，更需要有足够的分辨能力去判断哪些才是真正值得花时间去读的东西。

回到本书，作者讨论的是不确定性，以及应对不确定性需要的概率思维。应该说，这种不确定性对于大多数人来说都是非常颠覆的概念，作为一个物理专业出身的理科生，我对此并不陌生，量子力学里的不确定原理，薛定谔的猫都是讲这件事的。但是，因为我一直信奉爱因斯坦的一句话“God does not play dice”（上帝不掷骰子），并把这句话写在我量子力学课本的封皮上。所以我其实和大多数人一样，并不相信不确定性，认为不确定性只是因为没有搞懂，如果研究得足够清楚，一切都是确定的。我不知道有没有科学家（尤其是数学家）证明过，当系统复杂到一定程度，就不可能有确定性。但这个并不重要，反正现在没搞懂和永远都搞不懂，在现实意义上没有区别，我们只能接受不确定性的存在。

但是事实上很多人都拒绝接受不确定性的存在，比如那些孤注一掷的赌徒，不管是在赌场里扔骰子的还是在股市上压上所有身家，都具有这个共同点。这是比较极端的情况，大多数人还是比较容易理解，但放到稍微不那么极端的情况下，一般人就很容易被不确定性所迷惑了。作者拿自己所在的交易员行业举例，交易员（trader）的主要工作就是交易，在低价时买入，在高价时卖出。交易的内容，包括但不限于股票，期货，外汇等各种金融工具。所以交易员最重要的能力就是判断某种可以供交易的东西，是会升值还是贬值，如果你判断得足够准，你可以凭此赚到大钱。问题就是，这个不是那么容易的，否则谁都可以做交易员了。那么那些做得非常好，连续多年都在赚钱的金牌交易员就会被当做神一样供起来了，比如我们熟知的股神巴菲特。关于这种金牌交易员的传奇不胜其数，但就算是巴菲特，你应该把所有身家都交给他，让他帮你选股票么？

大多数人犯的错误，其实就是没有概率思维，光看到那些成功者的光鲜，而忽视了其脚底下无数的失败者，这被称为幸存者偏差。从概率上讲，样品总数非常重要。如果只有10个人在从事交易，那么一个人连续5年都在赚钱，这是非常厉害的，值得信任。但如果有一万个交易员，即便这些交易员完全不懂交易，天天靠扔骰子来决定买卖，这样他们每年赚钱的可能性也还有50%，这就意味着一年后会有5000个交易员赚到钱了继续做交易员，我们假设亏钱的5000个交易员被解雇，第二年过去，还会有2500个交易员继续赚钱（也就是连续两年赚钱），这么算下去，10000个交易员里也会有差不多300个能够连续五年凭着扔骰子赚到钱。如果你相信了这300个交易员辉煌的过往业绩，把你的全部积蓄拿出来交给他们帮你打理投资，很有可能第六年你就会亏得血本无归，即便第六年还在赚钱，总有一年你会吐血的，因为这是在扔骰子嘛。

所以幸存者偏差讲的就是，光看到幸存下来的成功者，没有看到其背后的样品总量。这么一看，大家就明白其实很多成功者其实就是运气好而已。我这里说很多，而不是所有，里面的差别自己慢慢体会吧。这其实是很反鸡汤的，我们常见的鸡汤是去把那300个连续五年赚钱的交易员的童年经历都挖出来，然后总结出一些共同之处，告诉你这些品质就是成功者需要的品质。比如说乐观，所有的成功学都告诉你，乐观是成功者必备的品质，因为所有的成功者都很乐观。他们没有告诉你的是，所有的失败者也都很乐观，因为乐观的人一般会低估不确定性的影响，从而更容易做一些冒险的事，一部分人运气好冒险成功了，就变成成功人士出现在世人眼前兜售他们的鸡汤，但更多的人冒险失败了，失败了就失败了，世人根本就看不见他们，看不见他们身上的乐观品质。

再回过头来看那些公众号和朋友圈里的鸡汤文，你就懒得去打击他们的积极性了……
