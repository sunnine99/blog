刚看完part 1，作者本来讨论的东西先不说，作者在书中流露出来的工作观就很颠覆，来看一下真正的聪明人是怎么看待工作和挣钱的。

work hard不等于think hard

>Trading forces someone to think hard; those who merely work hard generally lose their focus and intellectual energy. In addition, they end up drowning in randomness; work ethics, Nero believes, draw people to focus on noise rather than the signal.

关于牙医和歌星

>Arguably, in expectation, a dentist is considerably richer than the rock musician who is driven in a pink Rolls Royce, the speculator who bids up the price of impressionist paintings, or the entrepreneur who collects private jets. For one cannot consider a profession without taking into account the average of the people who enter it, not the sample of those who have succeeded in it.
>
the public observes the external signs of wealth without even having a glimpse at the source.

关于数学

>Mathematics is not just a “numbers game,” it is a way of thinking.

关于读了PHD却又放弃做科研

>Particularly thoughtful are those who had to abandon scientific studies because of their inability to keep focused on a narrowly defined problem.

勿以成败论英雄

>Heroes are heroes because they are heroic in behavior, not because they won or lost.

关于常识

>common sense is nothing but a collection of misconceptions acquired by age eighteen.

一个人不可能一辈子都靠运气

>The lucky fool might have benefited from some luck in life; over the longer run he would slowly converge to the state of a less-lucky idiot. Each one would revert to his long-term properties.

关于拥有财富的心态

>Following the incident, John regarded himself “ruined”; yet his net worth is still close to $1 million, which could be the envy of more than 99.9% of the inhabitants of our planet. Yet there is a difference between a wealth level reached from above and a wealth reached from below. The road from $16 million to $1 million is not as pleasant as the one from 0 to $1 million.

因为概率分布函数的不对称性，期望值(expectation)不等于中值(medium)

>As we saw in the last chapter, markets (and life) are not simple win/lose types of situations, as the cost of the losses can be markedly different from that of the wins. Maximizing the probability of winning does not lead to maximizing the expectation from the game when one’s strategy may include skewness, i.e., a small chance of large loss and a large chance of a small win.

关于读书

>in spite of my being a voracious reader, I have rarely been truly affected in my behavior (in any durable manner) by anything I have read. A book can make a strong impression, but such an impression tends to wane after some newer impression replaces it in my brain (a new book). I have to discover things by myself (recall the “Stove Is Hot” section in Chapter 3). These self-discoveries last.

挣钱的目的！树立正确的金钱观！顺带讽刺一下努力工作是能力平庸。这段话我应该打印出来贴在床头或者镜子上，天天起床时就读一遍！

>I suddenly felt financially insecure and feared becoming an employee of some firm that would turn me into a corporate slave with “work ethics” (whenever I hear work ethics I interpret inefficient mediocrity). I needed the backing of my bank account so I could buy time to think and enjoy life.

关于科学

>Science is mere speculation, mere formulation of conjecture.

人类之所以喜欢总结规律，是为了方便记忆！

>Induction is going from plenty of particulars to the general. It is very handy, as the general takes much less room in one’s memory than a collection of particulars.

关于资本主义，不需要讲道德。有钱既不是美德也不是罪过，跟道德无关。

>The virtue of capitalism is that society can take advantage of people’s greed rather than their benevolence, but there is no need to, in addition, extol such greed as a moral (or intellectual) accomplishment (the reader can easily see that, aside from very few exceptions like George Soros, I am not impressed by people with money). Becoming rich is not directly a moral achievement, but that is not where the severe flaw in the book lies.

经常有人把乐观作为成功者的一个特性，这是因为幸存者偏差，因为乐观者低估了风险，更倾向于冒险（赌博），所以要么很成功在世人面前展现成功者的乐观，要么就惨败被世人所遗忘。所以乐观的人起伏更大而已。

>Optimism, it is said, is predictive of success. Predictive? It can also be predictive of failure. Optimistic people certainly take more risks as they are overconfident about the odds; those who win show up among the rich and famous, others fail and disappear from the analyses. Sadly.

在trading的世界里，只需要学会如何买进和卖出，这比炒鸡蛋还容易

>He has what he claims is a good track record. All I can infer is that he has learned to buy and sell. And it is harder to fry an egg than buy and sell.

而赚钱赔钱很可能完全靠运气，基本啥都不会，随机投资，赚钱赔钱概率跟扔硬币一样，各50%，那么如果有10000个投资经理在纯凭运气投资，也会有313个人会连续五年赚钱（50%的五次方），所以以前的record其实也说明不了问题，这更多的取决于总样本数量而已。但总会有人去总结这些靠运气的“成功者”的特性，还说得像模像样的。

>Meanwhile if we throw one of these successful traders into the real world we would get very interesting and helpful comments on his remarkable style, his incisive mind, and the influences that helped him achieve such success. Some analysts may attribute his achievement to precise elements among his childhood experiences. His biographer will dwell on the wonderful role models provided by his parents; we would be supplied with black-and-white pictures in the middle of the book of a great mind in the making. And the following year, should he stop outperforming (recall that his odds of having a good year have stayed at 50%) they would start laying blame, finding fault with the relaxation in his work ethics, or his dissipated lifestyle. They will find something he did before when he was successful that he has subsequently stopped doing, and attribute his failure to that. The truth will be, however, that he simply ran out of luck.

所以，判断一个投资者的水平不能光看他的record，更大程度取决于总样本数量。

>Recall that the survivorship bias depends on the size of the initial population. The information that a person derived some profits in the past, just by itself, is neither meaningful nor relevant. We need to know the size of the population from which he came. In other words, without knowing how many managers out there have tried and failed, we will not be able to assess the validity of the track record. If the initial population includes ten managers, then I would give the performer half my savings without a blink. If the initial population is composed of 10,000 managers, I would ignore the results. The latter situation is generally the case; these days so many people have been drawn to the financial markets. Many college graduates are trading as a first career, failing, then going to dental school.
