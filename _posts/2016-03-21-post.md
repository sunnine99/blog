Yesterday is the first day of Implementation of final plan, however, it was a totally disaster, which made me very depressed. The main content of my final plan includes 4 hrs' listening and 1 hr's shadow, which requires 5 hrs' focused time. Actually the maximum focused time of one week, is 37 hrs, which means I will have put all my focused time on this plan and can not do anything else. And I don't want to do this in my working hour (8-5), when I want to do some other focused things. How can I achieve my goal?
