我们应该做的是追求truth和excellence，reward只是副产物，会伴随着这种不懈的追求出现。

>the systematic pursuit of truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit.

Ray说的一定要有原则，是不是就是我常说的，一定得有自己的想法。但是Ray的原则远远不限于此，所以他说我们要想相互理解，必须先理解对方的原则。

>I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.

足够有钱了之后对钱的看法：钱只要够用了，并不是越多越好。我目前要做的是，怎样才能past a certain point

>I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money.

关于现实主义和理想主义，不评论（偷笑）

>Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.

做困难的事，这就是我常常教育西西的话：难就对了。

>If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is the ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I believe that for the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace.
