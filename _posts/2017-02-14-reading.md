我们应该做的是追求truth和excellence，reward只是副产物，会伴随着这种不懈的追求出现。

>the systematic pursuit of truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit.

Ray说的一定要有原则，是不是就是我常说的，一定得有自己的想法。但是Ray的原则远远不限于此，所以他说我们要想相互理解，必须先理解对方的原则。

>I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.

足够有钱了之后对钱的看法：钱只要够用了，并不是越多越好。我目前要做的是，怎样才能past a certain point

>I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money.

关于现实主义和理想主义，不评论（偷笑）

>Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.

做困难的事，这就是我常常教育西西的话：难就对了。

>If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is the ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I believe that for the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace.

问问自己，是否有资格有自己的观点，好残酷的问题，但经常问问绝对是有好处的。像李笑来说的，努力让自己成为有资格说出自己观点的人。

>Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. As a general rule, if you have a demonstrated track record, then you can have an opinion of how to do it—if you don’t, you can’t, though you can have theories and questions.

桥水的核心价值观

>At Bridgewater, those key values are a drive for excellence, truth at all costs, a high sense of ownership, and strong character (by character, I mean the willingness to do the good but difficult things).

我都赞同，但我在我现在的工作中都找不到……

定义values, abilities, and skills

>Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently
>
So Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills.
>
Values are the deep-seated beliefs that motivate behaviors; people will fight for their values, and values determine people’s compatibility with others.
>
Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are great learners and fast processors; others possess common sense; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization, etc.
>
Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign language or write computer code. While values and abilities are unlikely to change much, most skills can be acquired in a limited amount of time (e.g., most master’s degrees can be acquired in two years) and often change in worth (e.g., today’s best programming language can be obsolete in a few years).
>
It is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to fit each role and, more broadly, with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships, values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least important.

这一段其实很好的解释了为什么很多人在学校里成绩很好，但是后来的发展却不尽如人意。因为他们更多地依赖自己的记忆，在学校的考试中很占便宜，但因为缺乏对隐藏在背后的原理的理解，所以在面对未知的时候，没有现成的答案，必须依靠自己的逻辑推理时，他们就不会推理型的人表现好了。

>Some people rely more on remembering what they were taught when making decisions, and others rely more on their independent reasoning.
>
Let’s call the first group memory-based learners and the second group reasoning-based thinkers. When using the word “learning” I intend to convey “acquiring knowledge by being taught,” and when using the word “thinking” I mean “figuring it out for oneself.” Memory-based learners approach decision-making by remembering what they were taught. They draw on their memory banks and follow the instructions stored there. They are typically left-brained. Reasoning-based thinkers pay more attention to the principles behind what happens. They are typically right-brained.
>
You can tell the difference when what is learned (e.g., CAPM) conflicts with what is logical (e.g., All Weather). People who rely on memory-based learning will typically be more skeptical of unconventional ideas because their process is to more readily accept what they have been told and because they are less able to assess it for themselves. Those who rely on more on reasoning won’t care much about convention and will assess ideas on their merits. Those who rely on memory-based learning also tend to align themselves with the consensus more than people who rely on reasoning. Memory-based learners are more willing to accept the status quo, while reasoning-based thinkers are less biased by it. They are more likely to be innovative, while those who rely on learning are likelier to be cautious.
>
Performance in school will correlate well with the quality of one’s learning-based thinking, but will not reliably correlate with one’s reasoning-based thinking. The most able learners are easily found, since they are, or were, the best students from the best schools. The best thinkers are tougher to find, as there are no obvious funnels through which they pass, especially before they develop track records in the “real world.”

招人的原则，skill最不重要，曾经是否outstand

>Weigh values and abilities more heavily than skills in deciding whom to hire.
>
Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those.”
>
So when reviewing a candidate’s background, you must identify how this person has demonstrated himself to be outstanding.

还有一条关于如何pay的，只能一声长叹

>Pay for the person, not for the job. Look at what they were paid before and what people with comparable credentials get paid and pay some premium to that, but don’t pay based on the job title.

问题有可能是一次性的（偶然的），也可能是因为自己的root cause引起的不断重复出现的，我们需要搞清楚是哪种情况。

>any one problem can either be a one-off imperfection or symptomatic of root causes that will show up as problems repeatedly

Ray很喜欢强调character

>Character is the ability to get yourself to do the difficult but right things.

这样做需要好大的勇气……

>The people who work for you should constantly challenge you, in order for you to become as good as you can be.

Ray真是对学校（尤其是中小学）教育耿耿于怀啊，继续分析在学校成绩好的原因，并且指出如果不能充分认识到两种不同的学习模式，对人生非常危险。

>A huge difference exists between memory-based “book” learning and hands-on, internalized learning. A medical student who has “learned” to perform an operation in his medical school class has not learned it in the same way as a doctor who has already conducted several operations. In the first case, the learning is stored in the conscious mind, and the medical student draws on his memory bank to remember what he has learned. In the second case, what the doctor has learned through hands-on experience is stored in the subconscious mind and pops up without his consciously recalling it from the memory bank. People who excel at book learning tend to call up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions. Others who are better at internalized learning use the thoughts that flow from their subconscious. The experienced skier doesn’t recite instructions on how to ski and then execute them; rather, he does it well “without thinking,” in the same way he breathes without thinking. Understanding these differences is essential. Remember that experience creates internalization. Doing things repeatedly leads to internalization, which produces a quality of understanding that is generally vastly superior to intellectualized learning.
>
I believe that school overrates the importance of intellectualized learning. People who were terrific in school and very good at this type of learning tend to overvalue it, or at least fail to distinguish it from the experiential/internalized kind of learning. This lack of differentiation can become a great peril later in life. Many people who have had great academic success need to be mindful of this challenge, especially if their success has been in the “sciences,” such as math and engineering. I also believe this is why hands-on experience is particularly valuable for these types of people.

终于读完了，但是觉得读书笔记好难写。

我也不知道这算不算读书笔记，至少碎片式的写作，不一定能组成一篇文章，不过这并不重要，重要的是现在把一些核心的理念真正理解了，并且找到适用于自己的原则。

（一）

>I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life.

每个人都必须有自己的原则，这样在遇到问题时才能做出正确的选择。

我自己有个说法是，要想做好一件事（工作），必须得有自己的想法。关于想法，以前应该有所总结，从笔记里找到一段，放在这里，不再重复写了。

>（2016-1-20）说到践行，其实在Bruker做得还算不错的，就是去践行了杨林涛教给我的这个概念：“用户跟客户说的话，比销售说的话管用多了。”（潜台词是：一定要让用户帮我们说好话）以前是怎么理解这个事呢，用自己以前的话说叫：要想做成事，首先得有想法。换成现在的从李笑来那里拿来的话说：践行最重要的概念。good，我其实也不是不明白这个道理，只不过表述不同，贯彻得不够坚决彻底而已。当然可能更重要的原因是，自己就没找到那个最重要的概念！

这一段说得更详细

>(2013-4-4)我想现在我要是回去做销售，一定能够比以前做得更好，因为现在的我，对此更加有想法。以我自己的经验，要想把一件事做好，没有想法是不可能的，就像我在CT时那样。
>
以前在布鲁克的时候，想法很单纯，就是觉得自己说好没用，效果远不如让用户帮你说好，所以花了很多时间去经营客户关系，尤其在西安，一个是西安用户的水平较低，自己这种水平还能帮上忙，二是公司的氛围给力，维修和应用的支持很到位，自己就可以直接调用这些资源。这两点，在CT都做不到。
>
当然这个想法来自于杨林涛，而关键是我自身非常认同这个想法。这使得我能够跳出一单一单的具体战术，能够从一个更高的战略层面去思考和行动。

Dalio的说法是，不管是做好某一件事，还是过好这一辈子，都必须有自己的原则，而且是一系列原则。只有这样，当我们面临选择时，才能依据我们的原则作出正确的选择。不管是深度，还是广度，Dalio都远胜于我，要不然怎么人家是亿万富翁而我只是个穷屌丝？当然明白了这一点远远不够，我们要搞清楚我们的原则是怎么来的？然后如何去修正自己的原则。

（二）

>I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.

理解别人就必须首先理解别人的原则。

如果说“要有原则”这一点，我还有过类似虽然都谈不上接近的想法，对于这一点，我是完全没有任何概念。事实上人际一直是我的弱项，即便是在Bruker干过三年销售，我的人际敏感度也并没增强多少。或许我那几年比较成功的是让自己的行为方式变得让别人更舒服一点，但对于理解别人并没有本质性的提高。

不管是客户，还是同事，或是竞争对手，我都需要尽快理解这个人的原则，这样才能知道该如何正确的相处（应对）。都别说这些因为工作而认识的人了，我甚至连自己的爱人还没有真正理解，至少没有明确总结过她的原则，然后有清晰的原则去相处。这也是为什么我们在一起都12年了，还经常会为一些事件闹得不愉快，因为没有真正理解对方。所以或许我首先需要总结的原则就是如何跟爱人相处，相对于自己的人生前途，这个原则的总结会容易很多，而且也紧迫很多。

（三）

>Those principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions.

最有价值的原则是那些从自己的经验中反思获得的。我们需要在实际生活中去精修我们的原则。

最初的原则是怎么来的并不重要，有的是我们自己的，有的可能是从别人那里来的。重要的是，我们要在实际生活中，尤其是面对困难的选择时，通过行动/反馈去精修自己的原则，通过自己亲身的经历，去找到那些最适合自己的原则。我们需要花很长时间去寻找/精修自己的原则，但一旦建立起适合自己的原则后，会让自己受益终生的，所以这个过程是绝对值得的。

（四）

>To be successful, you must make correct, tough choices. You must be able to “cut off a leg to save a life,” both on an individual level and, if you lead people, on a group level.

为了做成某些事，你必须做成正确的，艰难的选择。

这是为了解释为什么有原则这么重要，因为是自己的原则，决定了自己的选择。没有面临选择时，尤其是没有面临很艰难的选择时，类似需要“断腿保命”的时刻，就像电影72小时里那样，我们有没有原则其实无所谓，但是一旦面临痛苦的选择时，如何才能做出正确的选择，取决于我们有什么样的原则。

（五）

>In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.
>
One thing I wanted was spending money.

成为有钱人的先决条件，你得先有这个动机。我以前最糟糕的是没有这样的动机。现在终于有了，因为我需要（像Taleb一样），buy time to think and enjoy life。

知道自己想要什么，然后就为此去努力。这是大多数人都做不到的，首先多数人就不知道自己想要什么，然后在知道自己想要什么的那少部分人里面，又有大多数人不会去努力。在少数中的少数人里，就是那些既知道自己想要什么，也会努力的人里面，又有绝大多数人不知道如何去努力。剩下的，能够figure out how to get what he wants，基本上想不成功也很难了。

（六）

>The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you have to be right when they’re wrong.

想赚钱，就得在大多数人都错的时候做对了。

想想这个真的好难，首先这份自信心就得非常强大。但是又要特别小心，过分自信更容易犯错……就算我们告诉自己，自信的原因是因为我们的知识和技能，但在充满随机性的市场中，随时会有不确定性因素。总之尽量避免可能的大损失，利用黑天鹅事件吧。

（七）

>I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong. I never cared much about others’ conclusions—only for the reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make sense to me. Through this process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot from a lot of great people.

去找能找到的最聪明（睿智）的人，跟他们讨论你的观点。不要过于关注他们的结论，重要的是他们得出自己结论所用到的推理过程，这个过程是否有意义才是关键。

引用一段张五常的文章来佐证这件事

>在大学念书时，我从不缺课的习惯就是为了要学老师的思考方法。所有要考的试都考过了，我就转作旁听生。有一次，赫舒拉发（J. Hirshleifer）在课后来问我：「你旁听了我六个学期，难道我所知的经济学你还未学全吗？」我回答说：「你的经济学我早从你的著作中学会了；我听你的课与经济学无关——我要学的是你思考的方法。」

话说张五常这个境界确实远超出一般人，如果我算一般人的水平的话。因为我上课的时候，能听懂老师讲什么就不错了，从来没有想过老师的思考方法，当然我的老师大多数也是讲别人的教材或者别人的理论，也谈不上自己的思考方法。没有机会听大师的课，不过估计有我还是只能挣扎于理解的边缘。要更进一步，必须先通过自学/预习等方法，把内容理解了，然后才有可能专注于如何思考。这还真是境界的问题，我到现在看文献，还没能够专注于思考方法，只图看懂。

正是因为难，所以如果通过努力能窥探到一点点这个境界的话，应该是会非常受益的。看张五常的文章，也会常常谈起思考是一件多么有乐趣的事，Taleb也会说挣钱就是为了"buy time to think and enjoy life"，我现在还在理解的边缘挣扎，完全没有享受到思考的乐趣。对了，还得提起大前研一，在《思考的技术》一书中讲自己在地铁上随机找一个东西来锻炼思考能力，都是牛人。要想真正有思考能力，就必须去理解牛人的思维方式。

从另外一个角度想想，张五常之所以有功夫去关心老师的思考方法，是因为他已经自己看书，把内容学懂了。这是他能够关注思考方法的前提，要么他在一起上课的同学之前就先把所有的内容自己搞懂了，要么他在别人已经考完试不再学习这一块内容的时候，还在琢磨。不管哪种情况，他都得比别人努力很多才有可能做到。这个隐含的前提可能很容易就忽视了，就像范老师给我说过他上大学时，唐有祺讲两个小时的课，他下来可能得花几倍的时间才能真正搞懂，这就远远比一般的学生强了，而张五常这种，我相信花的时间绝对不是几倍了。

还有一个问题，我能找到的smartest people是谁？

（八）

>I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences of my decisions, and learned and improved from this process.

用现实生活去检验和修正你的原则。

前面讲的这些原则都不是纸上谈兵的，而是用来解决实际生活和工作中的问题的。不仅如此，还要利用根据自己的原则做出的选择带来的结果，反过来去修正自己的原则。

（九）

>I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life, and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my realities.

失败只是因为不接受和没能成功面对现实，成功也仅仅是因为接受和成功面对现实。

这句话背后的含义，我认为是强调现实的重要性。如果我们想成功，就不能活在自己的世界里，而必须去面对现实世界，让自己去适应现实世界，而不是让现实世界来接受自己。

更进一步说，如果想要成功，就必须让自己投身于残酷的现实社会中，去直面最血淋淋的事实，包括弱肉强食的丛林法则，冷酷无情只会逐利的资本本性，赢者通吃的社会法则，等等。敢不敢脱掉幻想的防弹衣，让自己的肉身去亲临前线的枪林弹雨？

在中国，为什么那么多人想进事业单位，想有编制，因为这些都是防弹衣，让他们不用直面现实社会，至少不用面对真实的现实社会。在“单位”里，有一套完全不同的玩法，更多的是利用国家机器强夺来的利益。

（十）

>I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an incredible beauty to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that made me and those around me appreciate our successes.
>
I believe that our society's “mistakephobia” is crippling, a problem that begins in most elementary schools, where we learn to learn what we are taught rather than to form our own goals and to figure out how to achieve them. We are fed with facts and tested and those who make the fewest mistakes are considered to be the smart ones, so we learn that it is embarrassing to not know and to make mistakes. Our education system spends virtually no time on how to learn from mistakes, yet this is critical to real learning. As a result, school typically doesn’t prepare young people for real life—unless their lives are spent following instructions and pleasing others. In my opinion, that’s why so many students who succeed in school fail in life.

如何面对自己的错误和弱点，是人与人之间最大的差异所在。

错误其实并不可怕，犯错正好是提高自己最好的机会。但是我们的社会从一开始的教育就忌讳犯错，比如小学的考试就是犯错最少的孩子成绩最好。这其实很有启发意义，我们是否可以设计一套考试制度，犯错并不重要，反正没有人能够完成所有的题目，那些做出了最难的题目的孩子，虽然犯错更多，但成绩还是会比那些犯错少，但没能完成更难的题目的孩子好？这只是一种思路，但我们确实需要反思现行的这套评分体系是否真正合理。
