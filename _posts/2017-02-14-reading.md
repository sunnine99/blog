我们应该做的是追求truth和excellence，reward只是副产物，会伴随着这种不懈的追求出现。

>the systematic pursuit of truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit.

Ray说的一定要有原则，是不是就是我常说的，一定得有自己的想法。但是Ray的原则远远不限于此，所以他说我们要想相互理解，必须先理解对方的原则。

>I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.

足够有钱了之后对钱的看法：钱只要够用了，并不是越多越好。我目前要做的是，怎样才能past a certain point

>I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money.

关于现实主义和理想主义，不评论（偷笑）

>Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.

做困难的事，这就是我常常教育西西的话：难就对了。

>If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is the ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I believe that for the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace.

问问自己，是否有资格有自己的观点，好残酷的问题，但经常问问绝对是有好处的。像李笑来说的，努力让自己成为有资格说出自己观点的人。

>Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. As a general rule, if you have a demonstrated track record, then you can have an opinion of how to do it—if you don’t, you can’t, though you can have theories and questions.

桥水的核心价值观

>At Bridgewater, those key values are a drive for excellence, truth at all costs, a high sense of ownership, and strong character (by character, I mean the willingness to do the good but difficult things).

我都赞同，但我在我现在的工作中都找不到……

定义values, abilities, and skills

>Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently
>
So Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills.
>
Values are the deep-seated beliefs that motivate behaviors; people will fight for their values, and values determine people’s compatibility with others.
>
Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are great learners and fast processors; others possess common sense; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization, etc.
>
Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign language or write computer code. While values and abilities are unlikely to change much, most skills can be acquired in a limited amount of time (e.g., most master’s degrees can be acquired in two years) and often change in worth (e.g., today’s best programming language can be obsolete in a few years).
>
It is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to fit each role and, more broadly, with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships, values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least important.

这一段其实很好的解释了为什么很多人在学校里成绩很好，但是后来的发展却不尽如人意。因为他们更多地依赖自己的记忆，在学校的考试中很占便宜，但因为缺乏对隐藏在背后的原理的理解，所以在面对未知的时候，没有现成的答案，必须依靠自己的逻辑推理时，他们就不会推理型的人表现好了。

>Some people rely more on remembering what they were taught when making decisions, and others rely more on their independent reasoning.
>
Let’s call the first group memory-based learners and the second group reasoning-based thinkers. When using the word “learning” I intend to convey “acquiring knowledge by being taught,” and when using the word “thinking” I mean “figuring it out for oneself.” Memory-based learners approach decision-making by remembering what they were taught. They draw on their memory banks and follow the instructions stored there. They are typically left-brained. Reasoning-based thinkers pay more attention to the principles behind what happens. They are typically right-brained.
>
You can tell the difference when what is learned (e.g., CAPM) conflicts with what is logical (e.g., All Weather). People who rely on memory-based learning will typically be more skeptical of unconventional ideas because their process is to more readily accept what they have been told and because they are less able to assess it for themselves. Those who rely on more on reasoning won’t care much about convention and will assess ideas on their merits. Those who rely on memory-based learning also tend to align themselves with the consensus more than people who rely on reasoning. Memory-based learners are more willing to accept the status quo, while reasoning-based thinkers are less biased by it. They are more likely to be innovative, while those who rely on learning are likelier to be cautious.
>
Performance in school will correlate well with the quality of one’s learning-based thinking, but will not reliably correlate with one’s reasoning-based thinking. The most able learners are easily found, since they are, or were, the best students from the best schools. The best thinkers are tougher to find, as there are no obvious funnels through which they pass, especially before they develop track records in the “real world.”

招人的原则，skill最不重要，曾经是否outstand

>Weigh values and abilities more heavily than skills in deciding whom to hire.
>
Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those.”
>
So when reviewing a candidate’s background, you must identify how this person has demonstrated himself to be outstanding.

还有一条关于如何pay的，只能一声长叹

>Pay for the person, not for the job. Look at what they were paid before and what people with comparable credentials get paid and pay some premium to that, but don’t pay based on the job title.
