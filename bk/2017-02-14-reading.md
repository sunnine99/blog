我们应该做的是追求truth和excellence，reward只是副产物，会伴随着这种不懈的追求出现。

>the systematic pursuit of truth and excellence and for the rewards that accompany this pursuit.

Ray说的一定要有原则，是不是就是我常说的，一定得有自己的想法。但是Ray的原则远远不限于此，所以他说我们要想相互理解，必须先理解对方的原则。

>I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life. I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.

足够有钱了之后对钱的看法：钱只要够用了，并不是越多越好。我目前要做的是，怎样才能past a certain point

>I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money.

关于现实主义和理想主义，不评论（偷笑）

>Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.

做困难的事，这就是我常常教育西西的话：难就对了。

>If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character. Character is the ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results. In other words, I believe that for the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace.

问问自己，是否有资格有自己的观点，好残酷的问题，但经常问问绝对是有好处的。像李笑来说的，努力让自己成为有资格说出自己观点的人。

>Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion. As a general rule, if you have a demonstrated track record, then you can have an opinion of how to do it—if you don’t, you can’t, though you can have theories and questions.

桥水的核心价值观

>At Bridgewater, those key values are a drive for excellence, truth at all costs, a high sense of ownership, and strong character (by character, I mean the willingness to do the good but difficult things).

我都赞同，但我在我现在的工作中都找不到……

定义values, abilities, and skills

>Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently
>
So Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills.
>
Values are the deep-seated beliefs that motivate behaviors; people will fight for their values, and values determine people’s compatibility with others.
>
Abilities are ways of thinking and behaving. Some people are great learners and fast processors; others possess common sense; still others think creatively or logically or with supreme organization, etc.
>
Skills are learned tools, such as being able to speak a foreign language or write computer code. While values and abilities are unlikely to change much, most skills can be acquired in a limited amount of time (e.g., most master’s degrees can be acquired in two years) and often change in worth (e.g., today’s best programming language can be obsolete in a few years).
>
It is important for you to know what mix of qualities is important to fit each role and, more broadly, with whom you can have successful relationships. In picking people for long-term relationships, values are most important, abilities come next, and skills are the least important.

这一段其实很好的解释了为什么很多人在学校里成绩很好，但是后来的发展却不尽如人意。因为他们更多地依赖自己的记忆，在学校的考试中很占便宜，但因为缺乏对隐藏在背后的原理的理解，所以在面对未知的时候，没有现成的答案，必须依靠自己的逻辑推理时，他们就不会推理型的人表现好了。

>Some people rely more on remembering what they were taught when making decisions, and others rely more on their independent reasoning.
>
Let’s call the first group memory-based learners and the second group reasoning-based thinkers. When using the word “learning” I intend to convey “acquiring knowledge by being taught,” and when using the word “thinking” I mean “figuring it out for oneself.” Memory-based learners approach decision-making by remembering what they were taught. They draw on their memory banks and follow the instructions stored there. They are typically left-brained. Reasoning-based thinkers pay more attention to the principles behind what happens. They are typically right-brained.
>
You can tell the difference when what is learned (e.g., CAPM) conflicts with what is logical (e.g., All Weather). People who rely on memory-based learning will typically be more skeptical of unconventional ideas because their process is to more readily accept what they have been told and because they are less able to assess it for themselves. Those who rely on more on reasoning won’t care much about convention and will assess ideas on their merits. Those who rely on memory-based learning also tend to align themselves with the consensus more than people who rely on reasoning. Memory-based learners are more willing to accept the status quo, while reasoning-based thinkers are less biased by it. They are more likely to be innovative, while those who rely on learning are likelier to be cautious.
>
Performance in school will correlate well with the quality of one’s learning-based thinking, but will not reliably correlate with one’s reasoning-based thinking. The most able learners are easily found, since they are, or were, the best students from the best schools. The best thinkers are tougher to find, as there are no obvious funnels through which they pass, especially before they develop track records in the “real world.”

招人的原则，skill最不重要，曾经是否outstand

>Weigh values and abilities more heavily than skills in deciding whom to hire.
>
Look for people who sparkle, not just “another one of those.”
>
So when reviewing a candidate’s background, you must identify how this person has demonstrated himself to be outstanding.

还有一条关于如何pay的，只能一声长叹

>Pay for the person, not for the job. Look at what they were paid before and what people with comparable credentials get paid and pay some premium to that, but don’t pay based on the job title.

问题有可能是一次性的（偶然的），也可能是因为自己的root cause引起的不断重复出现的，我们需要搞清楚是哪种情况。

>any one problem can either be a one-off imperfection or symptomatic of root causes that will show up as problems repeatedly

Ray很喜欢强调character

>Character is the ability to get yourself to do the difficult but right things.

这样做需要好大的勇气……

>The people who work for you should constantly challenge you, in order for you to become as good as you can be.

Ray真是对学校（尤其是中小学）教育耿耿于怀啊，继续分析在学校成绩好的原因，并且指出如果不能充分认识到两种不同的学习模式，对人生非常危险。

>A huge difference exists between memory-based “book” learning and hands-on, internalized learning. A medical student who has “learned” to perform an operation in his medical school class has not learned it in the same way as a doctor who has already conducted several operations. In the first case, the learning is stored in the conscious mind, and the medical student draws on his memory bank to remember what he has learned. In the second case, what the doctor has learned through hands-on experience is stored in the subconscious mind and pops up without his consciously recalling it from the memory bank. People who excel at book learning tend to call up from memory what they have learned in order to follow stored instructions. Others who are better at internalized learning use the thoughts that flow from their subconscious. The experienced skier doesn’t recite instructions on how to ski and then execute them; rather, he does it well “without thinking,” in the same way he breathes without thinking. Understanding these differences is essential. Remember that experience creates internalization. Doing things repeatedly leads to internalization, which produces a quality of understanding that is generally vastly superior to intellectualized learning.
>
I believe that school overrates the importance of intellectualized learning. People who were terrific in school and very good at this type of learning tend to overvalue it, or at least fail to distinguish it from the experiential/internalized kind of learning. This lack of differentiation can become a great peril later in life. Many people who have had great academic success need to be mindful of this challenge, especially if their success has been in the “sciences,” such as math and engineering. I also believe this is why hands-on experience is particularly valuable for these types of people.

终于读完了，但是觉得读书笔记好难写。

***
<br>

2017-03-05

我也不知道这算不算读书笔记，至少碎片式的写作，不一定能组成一篇文章，不过这并不重要，重要的是现在把一些核心的理念真正理解了，并且找到适用于自己的原则。

（一）

>I believe that having principles that work is essential for getting what we want out of life.

每个人都必须有自己的原则，这样在遇到问题时才能做出正确的选择。

我自己有个说法是，要想做好一件事（工作），必须得有自己的想法。关于想法，以前应该有所总结，从笔记里找到一段，放在这里，不再重复写了。

>（2016-1-20）说到践行，其实在Bruker做得还算不错的，就是去践行了杨林涛教给我的这个概念：“用户跟客户说的话，比销售说的话管用多了。”（潜台词是：一定要让用户帮我们说好话）以前是怎么理解这个事呢，用自己以前的话说叫：要想做成事，首先得有想法。换成现在的从李笑来那里拿来的话说：践行最重要的概念。good，我其实也不是不明白这个道理，只不过表述不同，贯彻得不够坚决彻底而已。当然可能更重要的原因是，自己就没找到那个最重要的概念！

这一段说得更详细

>(2013-4-4)我想现在我要是回去做销售，一定能够比以前做得更好，因为现在的我，对此更加有想法。以我自己的经验，要想把一件事做好，没有想法是不可能的，就像我在CT时那样。
>
以前在布鲁克的时候，想法很单纯，就是觉得自己说好没用，效果远不如让用户帮你说好，所以花了很多时间去经营客户关系，尤其在西安，一个是西安用户的水平较低，自己这种水平还能帮上忙，二是公司的氛围给力，维修和应用的支持很到位，自己就可以直接调用这些资源。这两点，在CT都做不到。
>
当然这个想法来自于杨林涛，而关键是我自身非常认同这个想法。这使得我能够跳出一单一单的具体战术，能够从一个更高的战略层面去思考和行动。

Dalio的说法是，不管是做好某一件事，还是过好这一辈子，都必须有自己的原则，而且是一系列原则。只有这样，当我们面临选择时，才能依据我们的原则作出正确的选择。不管是深度，还是广度，Dalio都远胜于我，要不然怎么人家是亿万富翁而我只是个穷屌丝？当然明白了这一点远远不够，我们要搞清楚我们的原则是怎么来的？然后如何去修正自己的原则。

（二）

>I also believe that to understand each other we have to understand each other’s principles.

理解别人就必须首先理解别人的原则。

如果说“要有原则”这一点，我还有过类似虽然都谈不上接近的想法，对于这一点，我是完全没有任何概念。事实上人际一直是我的弱项，即便是在Bruker干过三年销售，我的人际敏感度也并没增强多少。或许我那几年比较成功的是让自己的行为方式变得让别人更舒服一点，但对于理解别人并没有本质性的提高。

不管是客户，还是同事，或是竞争对手，我都需要尽快理解这个人的原则，这样才能知道该如何正确的相处（应对）。都别说这些因为工作而认识的人了，我甚至连自己的爱人还没有真正理解，至少没有明确总结过她的原则，然后有清晰的原则去相处。这也是为什么我们在一起都12年了，还经常会为一些事件闹得不愉快，因为没有真正理解对方。所以或许我首先需要总结的原则就是如何跟爱人相处，相对于自己的人生前途，这个原则的总结会容易很多，而且也紧迫很多。

（三）

>Those principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions.

最有价值的原则是那些从自己的经验中反思获得的。我们需要在实际生活中去精修我们的原则。

最初的原则是怎么来的并不重要，有的是我们自己的，有的可能是从别人那里来的。重要的是，我们要在实际生活中，尤其是面对困难的选择时，通过行动/反馈去精修自己的原则，通过自己亲身的经历，去找到那些最适合自己的原则。我们需要花很长时间去寻找/精修自己的原则，但一旦建立起适合自己的原则后，会让自己受益终生的，所以这个过程是绝对值得的。

（四）

>To be successful, you must make correct, tough choices. You must be able to “cut off a leg to save a life,” both on an individual level and, if you lead people, on a group level.

为了做成某些事，你必须做成正确的，艰难的选择。

这是为了解释为什么有原则这么重要，因为是自己的原则，决定了自己的选择。没有面临选择时，尤其是没有面临很艰难的选择时，类似需要“断腿保命”的时刻，就像电影72小时里那样，我们有没有原则其实无所谓，但是一旦面临痛苦的选择时，如何才能做出正确的选择，取决于我们有什么样的原则。

（五）

>In order to be motivated, I needed to work for what I wanted, not for what other people wanted me to do. And in order to be successful, I needed to figure out for myself how to get what I wanted, not remember the facts I was being told to remember.
>
One thing I wanted was spending money.

成为有钱人的先决条件，你得先有这个动机。我以前最糟糕的是没有这样的动机。现在终于有了，因为我需要（像Taleb一样），buy time to think and enjoy life。

知道自己想要什么，然后就为此去努力。这是大多数人都做不到的，首先多数人就不知道自己想要什么，然后在知道自己想要什么的那少部分人里面，又有大多数人不会去努力。在少数中的少数人里，就是那些既知道自己想要什么，也会努力的人里面，又有绝大多数人不知道如何去努力。剩下的，能够figure out how to get what he wants，基本上想不成功也很难了。

（六）

>The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker. To make any money, you have to be right when they’re wrong.

想赚钱，就得在大多数人都错的时候做对了。

想想这个真的好难，首先这份自信心就得非常强大。但是又要特别小心，过分自信更容易犯错……就算我们告诉自己，自信的原因是因为我们的知识和技能，但在充满随机性的市场中，随时会有不确定性因素。总之尽量避免可能的大损失，利用黑天鹅事件吧。

（七）

>I stress-tested my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong. I never cared much about others’ conclusions—only for the reasoning that led to these conclusions. That reasoning had to make sense to me. Through this process, I improved my chances of being right, and I learned a lot from a lot of great people.

去找能找到的最聪明（睿智）的人，跟他们讨论你的观点。不要过于关注他们的结论，重要的是他们得出自己结论所用到的推理过程，这个过程是否有意义才是关键。

引用一段张五常的文章来佐证这件事

>在大学念书时，我从不缺课的习惯就是为了要学老师的思考方法。所有要考的试都考过了，我就转作旁听生。有一次，赫舒拉发（J. Hirshleifer）在课后来问我：「你旁听了我六个学期，难道我所知的经济学你还未学全吗？」我回答说：「你的经济学我早从你的著作中学会了；我听你的课与经济学无关——我要学的是你思考的方法。」

话说张五常这个境界确实远超出一般人，如果我算一般人的水平的话。因为我上课的时候，能听懂老师讲什么就不错了，从来没有想过老师的思考方法，当然我的老师大多数也是讲别人的教材或者别人的理论，也谈不上自己的思考方法。没有机会听大师的课，不过估计有我还是只能挣扎于理解的边缘。要更进一步，必须先通过自学/预习等方法，把内容理解了，然后才有可能专注于如何思考。这还真是境界的问题，我到现在看文献，还没能够专注于思考方法，只图看懂。

正是因为难，所以如果通过努力能窥探到一点点这个境界的话，应该是会非常受益的。看张五常的文章，也会常常谈起思考是一件多么有乐趣的事，Taleb也会说挣钱就是为了"buy time to think and enjoy life"，我现在还在理解的边缘挣扎，完全没有享受到思考的乐趣。对了，还得提起大前研一，在《思考的技术》一书中讲自己在地铁上随机找一个东西来锻炼思考能力，都是牛人。要想真正有思考能力，就必须去理解牛人的思维方式。

从另外一个角度想想，张五常之所以有功夫去关心老师的思考方法，是因为他已经自己看书，把内容学懂了。这是他能够关注思考方法的前提，要么他在一起上课的同学之前就先把所有的内容自己搞懂了，要么他在别人已经考完试不再学习这一块内容的时候，还在琢磨。不管哪种情况，他都得比别人努力很多才有可能做到。这个隐含的前提可能很容易就忽视了，就像范老师给我说过他上大学时，唐有祺讲两个小时的课，他下来可能得花几倍的时间才能真正搞懂，这就远远比一般的学生强了，而张五常这种，我相信花的时间绝对不是几倍了。

还有一个问题，我能找到的smartest people是谁？

（八）

>I wrestled with my realities, reflected on the consequences of my decisions, and learned and improved from this process.

用现实生活去检验和修正你的原则。

前面讲的这些原则都不是纸上谈兵的，而是用来解决实际生活和工作中的问题的。不仅如此，还要利用根据自己的原则做出的选择带来的结果，反过来去修正自己的原则。

（九）

>I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life, and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my realities.

失败只是因为不接受和没能成功面对现实，成功也仅仅是因为接受和成功面对现实。

这句话背后的含义，我认为是强调现实的重要性。如果我们想成功，就不能活在自己的世界里，而必须去面对现实世界，让自己去适应现实世界，而不是让现实世界来接受自己。

更进一步说，如果想要成功，就必须让自己投身于残酷的现实社会中，去直面最血淋淋的事实，包括弱肉强食的丛林法则，冷酷无情只会逐利的资本本性，赢者通吃的社会法则，等等。敢不敢脱掉幻想的防弹衣，让自己的肉身去亲临前线的枪林弹雨？

在中国，为什么那么多人想进事业单位，想有编制，因为这些都是防弹衣，让他们不用直面现实社会，至少不用面对真实的现实社会。在“单位”里，有一套完全不同的玩法，更多的是利用国家机器强夺来的利益。

（十）

>I learned that everyone makes mistakes and has weaknesses and that one of the most important things that differentiates people is their approach to handling them. I learned that there is an incredible beauty to mistakes, because embedded in each mistake is a puzzle, and a gem that I could get if I solved it, i.e., a principle that I could use to reduce my mistakes in the future. I learned that each mistake was probably a reflection of something that I was (or others were) doing wrong, so if I could figure out what that was, I could learn how to be more effective. I learned that wrestling with my problems, mistakes, and weaknesses was the training that strengthened me. Also, I learned that it was the pain of this wrestling that made me and those around me appreciate our successes.
>
I believe that our society's “mistakephobia” is crippling, a problem that begins in most elementary schools, where we learn to learn what we are taught rather than to form our own goals and to figure out how to achieve them. We are fed with facts and tested and those who make the fewest mistakes are considered to be the smart ones, so we learn that it is embarrassing to not know and to make mistakes. Our education system spends virtually no time on how to learn from mistakes, yet this is critical to real learning. As a result, school typically doesn’t prepare young people for real life—unless their lives are spent following instructions and pleasing others. In my opinion, that’s why so many students who succeed in school fail in life.

如何面对自己的错误和弱点，是人与人之间最大的差异所在。

错误其实并不可怕，犯错正好是提高自己最好的机会。但是我们的社会从一开始的教育就忌讳犯错，比如小学的考试就是犯错最少的孩子成绩最好。这其实很有启发意义，我们是否可以设计一套考试制度，犯错并不重要，反正没有人能够完成所有的题目，那些做出了最难的题目的孩子，虽然犯错更多，但成绩还是会比那些犯错少，但没能完成更难的题目的孩子好？这只是一种思路，但我们确实需要反思现行的这套评分体系是否真正合理。

（十一）

>While most others seem to believe that learning what we are taught is the path to success, I believe that figuring out for yourself what you want and how to get it is a better path.

当大多数人以为成功之路就是学会别人教给你的东西，我却认为自己想办法搞定自己想要的东西是条更好的路。

所以越早知道自己想要什么，是个巨大的advantage，就像Denny Liu在他的长文中所说的那样

>不要去考虑什么天赋异禀，一切都来自经历和渴望。特别是这些年，当我认识了一些全中国、甚至全美国最“天才”的年轻人以后，才发现哪有什么天才，如果把他们的经历一个个说出来，大家肯定觉得完全就是一群苦逼啊。但这些苦逼有一个共同点，他们很清楚的知道自己究竟需要什么，并且很嗨地追求着。

原本想引用的那段在EverNote里面死活找不到，大意是Denny Liu这种22岁就年薪150万的牛人感慨，遇到了一些更牛的人，他们无一例外都是在十岁甚至不到十岁就已经清楚的知道自己要干什么了，所以他们从那时就开始投入了，其实都不能叫努力，就是喜欢然后就拼命去做，这是一种无法逾越的鸿沟——时间。当然以上的话都已经经过我的再加工了，总之就算知道这个道理，也未必能找到自己喜欢做的事。Denny介绍了一种方法，我也试过，好像也还是不行，或许我试得还不够深入？

还有一种可能性，就像李笑来说的，喜欢做一件事是因为做得比别人好，做得有成就感了。如果是这样的话，我就看看什么事能让自己收益最大，然后就努力去学努力去做，做好了就自然喜欢了。就算什么都不喜欢，我也会喜欢钱的，钱是个好东西，就算是我这种生活比较简单的人，也会体会到钱带来的好处。有钱才能"buy time to think and enjoy life"！那就不用折腾了，从此以后，知道自己喜欢挣钱，那就死命琢磨怎么才能挣钱吧。

（十二）

>While most others seem to believe that having answers is better than having questions, I believe that having questions is better than having answers because it leads to more learning.
>
In fact I believe that most people who are quick to come up with answers simply haven’t thought about all the ways that they can be wrong.

当大多数人都以为有答案比有问题更好，我却认为有问题比有答案更好，因为有问题才能学到更多。事实上大多数人之所以很快就能找到答案，仅仅是因为他们并没有深入地思考所有他们有可能出错的地方。

问题引起思考，好的问题才能引发高质量的思考。我自己似乎不太擅长于通过提出问题来学习和进步。Dalio介绍自己读财报的方式，就是通过提出各种问题。

>So I ordered all the annual reports and worked my way through the most interesting ones and formed opinions about which companies were exciting. The way I learn is to immerse myself in something, which prompts questions, which I answer, prompting more questions, until I reach a conclusion.

好像有本书就叫如何提问，但一定需要看这种书才能学会吗？Teleb也说要think harder，而不是work harder，套用一句流行语，不要用战术上的勤奋掩盖战略上的懒惰。或者说，做对的事比把事做对更重要。这些都是讲的一回事吗？要想think harder，最好的方式是不是就是提出各种刁难的问题逼着自己回答或者面对？

（十三）

>While most others seem to believe that mistakes are bad things, I believe mistakes are good things because I believe that most learning comes via making mistakes and reflecting on them.
>
While most others seem to believe that finding out about one’s weaknesses is a bad thing, I believe that it is a good thing because it is the first step toward finding out what to do about them and not letting them stand in your way.
>
While most others seem to believe that pain is bad, I believe that pain is required to become stronger.

错误，缺点，痛苦，这些别人以为不好的东西，实际上都是很好的东西，就看你如何对待它们了。

从principles里学到一个短语，叫head on，比如面对错误，缺点和痛苦，face them head on，意思是正面地（迎接，面对），不逃避。对于一直习惯于逃避问题的我来说，真的需要建立一些这方面的原则，然后监督自己去执行。这一方面，看过一个TED就讲通过被人拒绝一百次的方式来锻炼自己。[Jia Jiang:What I learned from 100 days of rejection](https://www.ted.com/talks/jia_jiang_what_i_learned_from_100_days_of_rejection)

有点变态，但其实最后就发现，自己害怕逃避的结果（failure/rejection）其实也没什么大不了的，尤其是我们能从中学到有价值的东西的话。

（十四）

>Yes, I started Bridgewater from scratch, and now it’s a uniquely successful company and I am on the Forbes 400 list. But these results were never my goals—they were just residual outcomes—so my getting them can’t be indications of my success.
>
I can’t comment on what having a lot of money means to others, but I do know that for me, having a lot more money isn’t a lot better than having enough to cover the basics. That’s because, for me, the best things in life—meaningful work, meaningful relationships, interesting experiences, good food, sleep, music, ideas, sex, and other basic needs and pleasures—are not, past a certain point, materially improved upon by having a lot of money.

很有钱不是目的，只是"residual outcomes"。

注意，Dalio说的是很有钱不是目的，下面也解释了，只要"having enough to cover the basics"了，钱并不是越多越好。所以这话等我先实现财富自由了再说，现在先专注于如何让自己有足够的钱cover那些basics。Dalio进一步解释了

>For me, money has always been very important to the point that I could have these basics covered and never very important beyond that. That doesn’t mean that I don’t think that having more is good–it’s just that I don’t think it’s a big deal.

并不是说越多并不是越好，越多是越好，只不过已经不是那么重要了。这话非常make sense，而在足够之前，钱不仅重要，而且非常非常重要！掌握好这个度，其实也不难，至少我不会担心自己掉钱眼里出不来。

（十五）

>1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress-testing my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.

Dalio最重要也是最基本的五条原则。

为什么有时候环境（氛围）很重要呢，因为在好的环境中你能够找到smartest people来stress-test你的opinion。

***
<br>

2017-03-12

（十六）

>This brings me to my most fundamental principle:
>
Truth—more precisely, an accurate understanding of reality—is the essential foundation for producing good outcomes.

Dalio自认为他最基本的原则，实际上也是（十五）的五条原则的最后一条（wrestling with reality）引申而来的。Dalio仔细解释了这一条

>In pursuing my goals I encountered realities, often in the form of problems, and I had to make decisions. I found that if I accepted the realities rather than wished that they didn’t exist and if I learned how to work with them rather than fight them, I could figure out how to get to my goals. It might take repeated tries, and seeking the input of others, but I could eventually get there.

注意这里提到的repeated tries，反复试错，做任何事其实都需要这样。但是有时候也需要耐心，不一定是某种方法不行，而是还没有坚持到看到成果就放弃了。这也是后面一条"seek the input of others"有时候为什么这么重要的原因吧？自己搞不定的时候，能够从别人那里得到帮助，其中，读书或许是最佳的策略，因为每个人不管人脉多广，处在的环境多好，认识的人毕竟有限，能找到的smartest people不见得是全世界最睿智的，但是读书是不受这个限制的。

顺带嘲讽了一下某不切实际的主义

>Success is achieved by people who deeply understand reality and know how to use it to get what they want. The converse is also true: idealists who are not well-grounded in reality create problems, not progress. For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.

关于什么是"好"什么是“坏”

>For example, I have found that by looking at what is rewarded and punished, and why, universally—i.e., in nature as well as in humanity—I have been able to learn more about what is “good” and “bad” than by listening to most people’s views about good and bad. It seems to me that what most people call “good” and “bad” typically reflects their particular group’s preferences: the Taliban’s definitions are different than Americans’, which are different than others’—and within each group there are differences and they are intended to paint a picture of the world the way they’d like it to be rather than the way it really is. So there are many different takes on what is good and bad that each group uses to call others “bad” and themselves “good,” some of which are practical and others of which are impractical. Yet all of them, and everything else, are subject to the same laws of nature–i.e., I believe that we all get rewarded and punished according to whether we operate in harmony or in conflict with nature’s laws, and that all societies will succeed or fail in the degrees that they operate consistently with these laws.

不同的人眼中的好坏标准其实是不一样的，但实际上我们可以找到一个共同的标准：consistent with natural laws

>This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws. In other words, for something to be “good” it must be grounded in reality. And if something is in conflict with reality—for example, if morality is in conflict with reality—it is “bad,” i.e., it will not produce good outcomes.

（十七）

>I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good.

由（十六）里的对好坏的判断标准，引出了这一条：进化，因为是为了更好地适应自然，所以是好的，而且最伟大的推动力。进一步：

>I believe that the desire to evolve, i.e., to get better, is probably humanity’s most pervasive driving force.

继续分析，追求的过程才会让我们满足，这也是为什么我们总是容易喜新厌旧，或者说不珍惜已经得到的东西。

>Though most people typically think that they are striving to get things (e.g., toys, better houses, money, status, etc.) that will make them happy, that is not usually the case. Instead, when we get the things we are striving for, we rarely remain satisfied.
>
Of course, we are often satisfied with the same things – relationships, careers, etc.—but when that is the case, it is typically because we are getting new enjoyments from the new dimensions of these things.
>
It is natural for us to seek other things or to seek to make the things we have better. In the process of this seeking, we continue to evolve and we contribute to the evolution of all that we have contact with. The things we are striving for are just the bait to get us to chase after them in order to make us evolve, and it is the evolution and not the reward itself that matters to us and those around us.

除了追求新的东西（seek other things），其实还可以通过让已有的东西变得更好（make the things we have better）来获得满足感。或者说从同样的东西，但是不同的维度去获得新的满足（get new enjoyments from the new dimensions of these things）。总之已经得到的东西确实不能再继续带来满足感（成就感）了，这是因为（经济学上的）边际递减定律？

>It is natural that it should be this way—i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals rather than by striving for them—because of the law of diminishing returns (The marginal benefits of moving from a shortage to an abundance of anything decline.).
>
For example, suppose making a lot of money is your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal utility. Then it would be foolish to continue to have making money be your goal. People who acquire things beyond their usefulness not only will derive little or no marginal gains from these acquisitions, but they also will experience negative consequences, as with any form of gluttony. So, because of the law of diminishing returns, it is only natural that seeking something new, or seeking new depths of something old, is required to bring us satisfaction.

gluttony，暴食，什么好东西吃多了都会带来负面的东西。

总结一下

>In other words, the sequence of 1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.

在得到自己追求的东西（目标）之后继续追求新的东西（目标），是人类的天性，也是人类自身和人类社会前进的推动力。如果用于两性关系，有的人只是把对方当做一个玩具，得到了就不再喜欢，其实不是不再喜欢了，而是因为gluttony，好东西吃太多也腻了。而有的人，则把对方当成一个有多种维度的独立个体，双方的关系远远不仅仅是得到对方，那只是一个开始，在那之后需要花更多的时间去了解对方，每个人身上的多重维度，而且随着生活很多东西还在不断变化，所以仅仅是试图去全面深入了解对方已经是非常困难了，何况除了了解，还需要在各种不同的问题上建立起双方都能够妥协的共同原则，实际上这会是一个贯穿双方共同人生的动态过程。得有多傻才会把对方当成一个玩具，得到了就要新的玩具？用Mindset的理论来讲，前者是fixed mindset，而我们需要的growth mindset，用变化的观点，而不是静态的观点去看待双方的关系。

>I believe that pursuing self-interest in harmony with the laws of the universe and contributing to evolution is universally rewarded, and what I call “good.”

追求自己的利益，但是与宇宙法则相符，并且能够对进化有帮助，这是最大的善，必将获得奖励。

相反，则会被惩罚。

>When pursuing self-interest is in conflict with evolution, it is typically punished.

自己的利益和社会的利益往往是共生的（symbiotic），所以追求自己的利益通常也能对社会有好处，反过来这也是激励个人去做难的事的动力所在。

>Self-interest and society’s interests are generally symbiotic: more than anything else, it is pursuit of self-interest that motivates people to push themselves to do the difficult things that benefit them and that contribute to society. In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants.

更关键的是，个人挣多少钱，是看他给社会提供了多少（社会想要的）价值，而不是看他自己想要多少。明白了这一点，就不会把挣很多钱作为自己的首要目标，因为这只是你个人的desire，社会根本不care，社会只会根据你对社会的贡献来嘉奖你，而不是你的欲望。这里还是要强调一下，不会把挣很多钱作为自己的首要目标，而不是不会把挣钱作为首要目标，这两者区别非常大。那个basic的点始终是一个标尺，过没过这个点至关重要，甚至决定生死存亡。

>That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted—NOT how much they desired to make money. Look at what caused people to make a lot of money and you will see that usually it is in proportion to their production of what the society wanted and largely unrelated to their desire to make money. There are many people who have made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their primary goal. Instead, they simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it.
>
And there are many people who really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they didn’t make a lot of money. In other words, there is an excellent correlation between giving society what it wants and making money, and almost no correlation between the desire to make money and how much money one makes.

Dalio又重复了一遍自己的观点：the law of diminishing returns和no marginal benefit

>I know that this is true for me—i.e., I never worked to make a lot of money, and if I had I would have stopped ages ago because of the law of diminishing returns. I know that the same is true for all the successful, healthy (i.e., non-obsessed) people I know.
>
I do know some successful people who are obsessed with making money despite making money having little or no marginal benefit for them.

（十九）

>The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.

（十八）说了追求个人利益是推动社会进步的动力，但是在追求个人利益的过程中，有的人非常成功，而有的人则不那么成功，区别在哪？学习能力和适应能力

>what differentiates man from other species is man’s greater ability to learn. Because we can learn, we can evolve more and faster than other species.

适应（环境变化的）能力，其实也应该算一种学习能力，一种特殊的，不同于通常意义上的学习能力。

>The faster that one appropriately adapts, the better. As Darwin described, adaptation—i.e., adjusting appropriately to changes in one’s circumstances—is a big part of the evolutionary process, and it is rewarded.
>
Darwin is reported to have said, “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.”
>
That is why some of the most successful people are typically those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best adapt to it.
>
Your ability to see the changing landscape and adapt is more a function of your perceptive and reasoning abilities than your ability to learn and process quickly.

学习能力和适应能力说白了就需要人用理性去反思自己和自己周边的东西，这就需要我们更多地应用我们的理性大脑，而不是情绪大脑，后者是阻碍我们进步的最大障碍。

>Unlike any other species, man is capable of reflecting on himself and the things around him to learn and adapt in order to improve. He has this capability because, in the evolution of species man’s brain developed a part that no other species has—the prefrontal cortex. It is the part of the human brain that gives us the ability to reflect and conduct other cognitive thinking. Because of this, people who can objectively reflect on themselves and others —most importantly on their weaknesses are—can figure out how to get around these weaknesses, can evolve fastest and come closer to realizing their potentials than those who can’t.
>
However, typically defensive, emotional reactions—i.e., ego barriers—stand in the way of this progress. These reactions take place in the part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result of them, most people don’t like reflecting on their weaknesses even though recognizing them is an essential step toward preventing them from causing them problems. Most people especially dislike others exploring their weaknesses because it makes them feel attacked, which produces fight or flight reactions; however, having others help one find one’s weaknesses is essential because it’s very difficult to identify one’s own. Most people don’t like helping others explore their weaknesses, even though they are willing to talk about them behind their backs. For these reasons most people don’t do a good job of understanding themselves and adapting in order to get what they want most out of life. In my opinion, that is the biggest single problem of mankind because it, more than anything else, impedes people’s abilities to address all other problems and it is probably the greatest source of pain for most people.
>
Some people get over the ego barrier and others don’t. Which path they choose, more than anything else, determines how good their outcomes are. Aristotle defined tragedy as a bad outcome for a person because of a fatal flaw that he can’t get around. So it is tragic when people let ego barriers lead them to experience bad outcomes.

（二十）

>as we head toward our goals we encounter an enormous number of choices that come at us, and each decision we make has consequences. So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make. We literally make millions of decisions that add up to the consequences that are our lives.

选择的质量决定了人生的质量……

最重要的五个选择

1）关于pain

>It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way.

错误的态度

>allow pain to stand in the way of their progress

正确的态度

>Understand how to manage pain to produce progress

remember：

>Pain + Reflection = Progress

2）关于reality

>people who know that understanding what is real is the first step toward optimally dealing with it make better decisions.

错误的态度

>avoid facing "harsh realities"

正确的态度

>face "harsh realities"

remember：

>Ask yourself, “Is it true?”

3）关于weaknesses

>People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future.

错误的态度

>worry about appearing good

正确的态度

>worry about achieving the goal

think：

>what are your biggest weaknesses? Think honestly about them because if you can identify them, you are on the first step toward accelerating your movement forward. So think about them, write them down, and look at them frequently.

4）关于consequences

>People who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects that the second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their goals.

错误的态度

>make their decisions on the basis of first-order consequences

正确的态度

>make their decisions on the basis of first-, second- and third- order consequences

5）关于accountability

>Successful people understand that bad things come at everyone and that it is their responsibility to make their lives what they want them to be by successfully dealing with whatever challenges they face.

错误的态度

>don't hold themselves accountable

正确的态度

>hold themselves accountable

总结一下

>In summary, I believe that you can probably get what you want out of life if you can suspend your ego and take a no-excuses approach to achieving your goals with open-mindedness, determination, and courage, especially if you rely on the help of people who are strong in areas that you are weak.


（二十一）

>If I had to pick just one quality that those who make the right choices have, it is character.
>
Character is the ability to get one’s self to do the difficult things that produce the desired results.

性格决定命运？只有知难而上才能心想事成

>In other words, I believe that for the most part, achieving success—whatever that is for you—is mostly a matter of personal choice and that, initially, making the right choices can be difficult. However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace.

character在这本书里反复提到，比如说公司招人的原则

>Most importantly, find people who share your values. At Bridgewater, those key values are a drive for excellence, truth at all costs, a high sense of ownership, and strong character (by character, I mean the willingness to do the good but difficult things).

关于负责任

>Hold yourself and others accountable. It is unacceptable for you to say you won’t fight for quality and truth because it makes you or other people uncomfortable. Character is the ability to get yourself to do the difficult but right things. Get over the discomfort, and force yourself to hold people accountable. The choice is between doing that properly or letting our community down by behaving in a way that isn’t good for you or the people you are “probing” and coaching.

这里没有提到character这个词，但意思也是一样：做困难的事

>By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn’t give a damn what you “like.” So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things—which often are difficult but produce good results—so that you’ll then deserve to get what you want.

（二十二）

>Those who are most successful are capable of “higher level thinking” —i.e., they are able to step back and design a “machine” consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want. They are able to assess and improve how their “machine” works by comparing the outcomes that the machine is producing with the goals.

higher level thinking，设计一个"machine"，然后不断地比较结果和目标，进而修正自己的设计。

>That schematic is meant to convey that your goals will determine the “machine” that you create to achieve them; that machine will produce outcomes that you should compare with your goals to judge how your machine is working. Your “machine” will consist of the design and people you choose to achieve the goals. For example, if you want to take a hill from an enemy you will need to figure out how to do that—e.g., your design might need two scouts, two snipers, four infantrymen, one person to deliver the food, etc. While having the right design is essential, it is only half the battle. It is equally important to put the right people in each of these positions. They need different qualities to play their positions well—e.g., the scouts must be fast runners, the snipers must be precise shots, etc. If your outcomes are inconsistent with your goals (e.g., if you are having problems), you need to modify your “machine,” which means that you either have to modify your design/culture or modify your people.

如果是一个群体的目标（公司），"machine"包括design和people，除了正确的设计，把正确的人放到正确的位置也至关重要。

>I call it “higher level thinking” because your perspective is of one who is looking down on at your machine and yourself objectively, using the feedback loop as I previously described. In other words, your most important role is to step back and design, operate and improve your “machine” to get what you want.

注意要step back，才能从更高的层次上思考问题。如果你的目标是赢球，就不要考虑自己是不是踢得舒服。Dalio用了two yous来举例，有两个你：

>Think of it as though there are two yous—you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve your goals (let’s call that one you(1)) and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission (which we will call you(2)). You(2) are a resource that you(1) have to get what you(1) want, but by no means your only resource. To be successful you(1) have to be objective about you(2).

you(1)是设计者（设计整个"machine"），you(2)是参与者（"machine"中的一员），这二者是不一样的。

>Let’s imagine that your goal is to have a winning basketball team. Wouldn’t it be silly to put yourself in a position that you don’t play well? If you did, you wouldn’t get what you want. Whatever your goals are, achieving them works the same way.

you(1)和you(2)，有点绕，但事实如此，跳出自身才叫higher level thinking

>If you(1) see that you(2) are not capable of doing something, it is only sensible for you(1) to have someone else do it. In other words, you(1) should look down on you(2) and all the other resources at your(1) disposal and create a “machine” to achieve your(1) goals, remembering that you(1) don’t necessarily need to do anything other than to design and manage the machine to get what you(1) want. If you(1) find that you(2) can’t do something well fire yourself(2) and get a good replacement! You shouldn’t be upset that you found out that you(2) are bad at that—you(1) should be happy because you(1) have improved your(1) chances of getting what you(1) want. If you(1) are disappointed because you(2) can’t be the best person to do everything, you(1) are terribly naïve because nobody can do everything well.

（二十三）

>There are five things that you have to do to get what you want out of life. First, you have to choose your goals, which will determine your direction. Then you have to design a plan to achieve your goals. On the way to your goals, you will encounter problems. As I mentioned, these problems typically cause pain. The most common source of pain is in exploring your mistakes and weaknesses. You will either react badly to the pain or react like a master problem solver. That is your choice. To figure out how to get around these problems you must be calm and analytical to accurately diagnose your problems. Only after you have an accurate diagnosis of them can you design a plan that will get you around your problems. Then you have to do the tasks specified in the plan.

具体操作层面上的五个步骤：5-step process

>Have clear goals.
>
Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals.
>
Accurately diagnose these problems.
>
Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals.
>
Implement these plans—i.e., do these tasks.

（二十四）

>Setting Goals: You can have virtually anything you want, but you can’t have everything you want.

理论上你可以做成任何事情，但是你没有那么多时间和精力。所以你必须选择最重要的目标去努力实现。

>Put another way, to achieve your goals you have to prioritize, and that includes rejecting good alternatives (so that you have the time and resources to pursue even better ones—time being probably your greatest limiting factor, though, through leverage, you can substantially reduce time’s constraints).

在这一步，一定要有big picture，清楚自己的目标，而不是迷失在每天（工作）的繁琐中，有句鸡汤叫：不要因为走得太远，而忘了自己为什么出发

>Another common reason people fail at this stage is that they lose sight of their goals, getting caught up in day-to-day tasks.

设定你想要的目标，不要管你能不能实现，那是其他几个步骤考虑的问题

>Avoid setting goals based on what you think you can achieve.

Dalio顺便讲了一下think creatively和work hard的关系

>Every time I set goals, I don’t yet have any idea how I am going to achieve them because I haven’t yet gone through the process of thinking through them. But I have learned that I can achieve them if I think creatively and work hard.
>
The more creative I am, the less hard I have to work.

>You must get at the root causes.
>
Root causes, like principles, are things that manifest themselves over and over again as the deep-seated reasons behind the actions that cause problems. So you will get many everlasting dividends if you can find them and properly deal with them.

根本原因，而不是表面原因，才是最重要的。因为这会导致问题以不同的表象不断地重复出现。如何辨别，看下一段

>It is important to distinguish root causes from proximate causes. Proximate causes typically are the actions or lack of actions that lead to problems—e.g., “I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule.” So proximate causes are typically described via verbs. Root causes are the deeper reasons behind the proximate cause: “I didn’t check the schedule because I am forgetful”—a root cause. Root causes are typically described with adjectives, usually characteristics about what the person is like that lead them to an action or an inaction.

proximate causes主要是用动词来描述，root causes用形容词来描述，是一种characteristics

（二十六）

>most learning comes from making mistakes and experiencing the pain of them—e.g., putting your hand on a hot stove—and adapting.

好吧，我的问题是太能逃避了，所以很多时候都没有机会犯错误，自然也不能从中学习和提高了。

>More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don’t is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively.

objectively，确实很难，尤其是对我这种经常会带有强烈的opinion，虽然我已经知道自己现在还不配有opinion。

>Remember that: Pain + Reflection = Progress

我得先有pain，先犯mistake，然后才可能有progress

（二十七）

>I believe the importance of good work habits is vastly underrated.
>
it is critical to know each day what you need to do and have the discipline to do it.

落实到具体行动，养成好的习惯，知道每天要做的事，足够自律去完成。

（读书笔记）

2017-03-23

花了一个月读完了Ray Dalio的《principles》，又花了一个月重新读了一遍前两部分，或许未来当我觉得自己又迷失的时候，我还会把这本书翻出来再读几遍。知道这本书是因为它是李笑来推荐的必读书之一，虽然我从来就不相信有什么书是一定要读的，但闲着也是闲着，就认真读了。Ray Dalio是桥水基金的创始人，而桥水基金是过去几十年内最成功最赚钱的对冲基金（没有之一），而Ray Dalio本人也是福布斯富豪榜前100名。介绍一件别人不熟的东西这事，还是wiki百科或者百度百科来做更有效率，引用一段：

>达里奥非常富有，去年一年他赚了二三十亿美元，在福布斯富豪排行榜上位居第55位。（注：2012年）
>
让达里奥有别于其他对冲基金经理的，是他对经济分析的深度，以及自命不凡的学术抱负。他很希望自己被视为别的什么，而不是亿万富翁和商人。实际上，和曾经的对手乔治·索罗斯一样，达里奥看起来更渴望成为一个世俗哲学家。
>
2008年10月，金融危机正处于鼎盛时期，他发表了文章《理解当下所发生事情的一个样板》。他在文章中称，经济面临的并非一场普通的衰退，而是减低借贷、重铸储蓄的时期，它的影响会让整整一代人感受到。
>
很多对冲基金经理日夜呆在电脑前，追踪市场动向。达里奥不喜欢这样。用他的话说就是：“几乎每样东西都像一台机器，大自然是台机器，家庭是台机器，生活周期像台机器……”他说，他始终如一的目标就是，弄懂经济这台机器是如何运转的。
>
达里奥确信，他在市场中依赖的箴言适用于生活中的其他方面，如职业发展和管理。桥水公司有一本100页厚的《行为准则》，每个新员工都得读它。这本《行为准则》可被视为一本自助手册和管理手册，以及关于自然选择定律应用于商业的专著。
>
在这本《行为准则》的第二页上写道：“我相信所有成功人士都会按照使他们获得成功的定律运作。”

对，我刚看过两遍的就是这本Dalio要求每个桥水员工必须读的《行为准则》，是关于Dalio本人和桥水公司的行为准则。

之前看完的那本《Fooled by Randomness》，作者Nassim Nicholas Taleb被称为“世界上最聪明的人之一”，他试图告诉我们，现实生活中很多成功者其实就是运气好而已。但他也同时强调了，这并不意味着所有的成功者都是因为运气好才成功，重要的是我们如何去理解现实生活中的各种因素，尤其是那些不确定因素。比如牙医的成功就很难靠运气，这基本上是一个纯技术工种，会就是会，不会是很难蒙对的。但是在金融行业里，只需要会买会卖，加上极为复杂的不确定因素，所以很多很多成功只是运气好。我自己喜欢这样去解读不确定性这件事，很多时候做对了一件事，很有可能是因为得到了错误的信息，然后加上错误的逻辑，却做出了正确的选择，所谓的负负得正。而有些人拿着错误的信息，加上正确的逻辑，或者有些人拿着正确的信息，却用了错误的逻辑，自然都做出了错误的选择。但不代表正确的结果就一定是因为用正确的方式做对了事。

从这个意义上讲，我无法用桥水公司的成功去反推Dalio的这些principles就是正确的。Dalio自己也不推荐读者这样去认为，他在书中反复地要求读者反问自己：“真的是这样的吗？”Dalio认为人生最重要的是选择（choice）而不是机会（chance），我们每个人能成为现在的自己，都是因为过去做出的无数的选择造成的结果。所以为了能够做出正确的选择，尤其是在一些非常关键的问题上，我们必须有自己的原则。而这些原则并不是每个人生下来就有的，所以我们需要去找到自己的原则，不管这些原则是自己想到的，而是别人教给你的，更重要的是，我们要用现实生活不断去检验并且修正自己的原则，确保自己在真正重要的问题上能够做出正确的选择。

从我自己的角度出发，生活在一个变化速度远超出普通人想象的社会，现实生活往往会让普通人的理想残酷的破灭。比如知乎上有人问为什么程序员提到跳槽就是镀金、加薪，而很少有人真正想做一款好产品？有一个答案是这样说的

>「老王啊，你家的楼盘能不能看着给我留一套？」
>
「能啊，给钱。」
>
「你怎么那么俗就知道钱，你看我做了一款好产品，你不给我房给谁啊？」
>
「喂，110 吗？这里有个神经病！」

所以我认为有自己的原则的原因不光是为了做出正确的选择，也是为了让自己过得更踏实一下，很多人生活得痛苦纠结只是因为他们原先笃信的东西都被现实生活摔得粉碎而他们还没能找到新的值的笃信的原则。事实上不管他们找到的原则是对是错，甚至是正常人眼里非常奇葩的原则，只要他们真的笃信，他们的内心就会因此而平和。这种人我们偶尔会遇见几个，我们觉得怎么还能有这么极品这么奇葩的人，但他们不care，他们反而过得比我们踏实，这就是原则的力量，这就是笃信的力量。在这样一个极品奇葩的现实世界里，很多时候我们的原则是对是错都已经不重要的，重要的是我们需要一个自己笃信的原则，才能让自己不会因为纠结和迷失而痛苦。从这个意义上讲，不管是芙蓉姐姐还是凤姐，她们的日子都比普通人强很多，对不起只能举出这么老的例子，因为不关注这些很多年了，所以新晋的网红一个都不认识。

这本书的第一节，就在分析为什么我们需要原则，我的读书笔记写到这里也就够了，具体的原则需要我们每个人自己去找寻答案，我在这里就不啰嗦了，也没有必要试图把自己的原则塞给别人，其实也是因为我自己还没找到呢！
