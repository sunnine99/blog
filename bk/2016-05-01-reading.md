Mindfulness meditation improves cognition: Evidence of brief mental training

about Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs, which are usually 8 weeks in duration and combine mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga

>MBSR programs are based on teaching participants to react nonjudgmentally to stressful events by focusing on automatic and dynamic stimuli (breath; body; eating; walking).
>
Although advantageous to well-being, MBSR programs require extensive time and financial commitment.

about mindfulness meditation (MM)

>MM is a mental practice based on focusing on the sensations of the breath/body while maintaining a relaxed state of mind. During formal meditation practice, distractions will arise and the meditator is taught to acknowledge discursive thoughts, and non-judgmentally return his/her attention back to their breathing (Wallace, 2006).

[The neuroscience of mindfulness meditation](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v16/n4/full/nrn3916.html)

about MM

> In current clinical and research contexts, mindfulness meditation is typically described as non-judgemental attention to experiences in the present moment.

From the cross-sectional studies we can not reveal the relationship between meditation and changing Brain

>Although correlational studies have attempted to discover whether more meditation experience is related to larger changes in brain structure or function, such correlations still cannot prove that meditation practice has caused the changes because it is possible that individuals with these particular brain characteristics may be drawn to longer meditation practice.

But from longitudinal studies, we can

>A lack of similar changes in the control group suggests that meditation has caused the observed changes, especially when other potentially confounding variables are controlled for properly

How the meditation changes the brain?

>Effects reported by individual studies have been found in multiple brain regions, including the cerebral cortex, subcortical grey and white matter, brain stem and cerebellum, suggesting that the effects of meditation might involve large-scale brain networks. This is not surprising because mindfulness practice involves multiple aspects of mental function that use multiple complex interactive networks in the brain.

[Effects of brief and sham mindfulness meditation on mood and cardiovascular variables.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20666590?dopt=Abstract&holding=npg)

meditation can reduce HR and BP! amazing!

>It is well established that elevated blood pressure (BP) is associated with cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, long-term meditation practice has been shown to reduce heart rate (HR) and BP.

for the real meditation

>In session 1, small groups of 5–8 participants sat in chairs, and were instructed to close their eyes and relax. They were then instructed to focus on the flow of their breath. If a random thought arose, they were told to passively notice and acknowledge the thought and to simply let ‘‘it’’ go, by bringing the attention back to the sensations of the breath. The last 7 minutes of session 1 were held in silence, so that the participants could effectively practice mindfulness meditation. In session 2, the facilitator instructed participants to focus on the ‘‘full breath,’’ (sensations in the nostrils and abdomen); the last 7 minutes of session 2 were held in silence. Session 3 was an extension of sessions 1 and 2. As a manipulation check, each subject was asked, individually, ‘‘if they felt that they were truly meditating’’ after each meditation session. Every subject responded with a ‘‘yes’’ to this question across all sessions.

for the sham meditation

>Sham meditation instruction was based on breathing exercises and reiterating the notion that they were meditating. In each session, the participants were told, approximately every 2–3 minutes, to "take
deep breaths as we sit in meditation."
>
This intervention differed notably from the mindfulness training because participants were not given the guided instructions (e.g., **focusing on the flow of the breath**) imperative for mindfulness meditation.

[李笑来：为什么我用“坐享”替代“打坐”、“禅修”、“冥想”等等词汇？](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzAwMDgyMTA3Mg==&mid=2650055269&idx=2&sn=9632a42e8e8b464a172b83b6303fbadf)

the simplest way to practice meditation

>1.找个计时器，定时 15 分钟以上（以后再慢慢加长）
>
2.找一个舒服的姿势（起初不一定要用不习惯的“正确姿势”）
>
3.闭眼（有人即便睁眼也能做到）

4.缓慢均匀地呼吸（不一定要刻意控制）

5.尽量专注于呼吸（别在乎自己走神了，发现自己走神就再回来）

[万维钢：想要提高效率，就得不公平](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/20836164)

good article, and we need really use this principle in our daily life.

>幂律分布，最早是在1897年被经济学家维弗雷多·帕累托发现，他正是在考察人群财富的时候发现的这个分布。他认为之所以会有这样的分布，是正反馈造成的，越有钱的人越容易赚钱。
>
现实世界中有很多东西是幂率分布的：公司的大小、城市的大小、病毒感染的人群、商品畅销程度……甚至有些自然现象也是如此：地震强度、油田大小，等等。
>
幂率分布到底是什么原因造成的？我看了很多文献，可以说现在没有一个统一的理论，正反馈过程只是其中一个可能的原因[1]。但我们更关心的是，这种分布意味着什么？
>
它意味着这个世界非常不均匀！
>
时至今日，科学研究已经不怎么讲英雄主义的时代，大多数重要科学发现也是由少数精英科学家做出，85%的科学论文从来没被引用过[2]，只有1%的论文在发表后一年内能被引用5次以上。很多人号称给维基百科和自由软件做过贡献，但大多数页面，大多数代码，是极少数人完成的 — 一半以上维基百科的编辑行为是0.7%的用户（大约五百多人）做的[3]。

what should we do?

>世界上绝大多数人和事都是平庸的，而且最好的东西还都挤在一起。
>
有了这个正确的世界观，我们才能有正确的方法论。这个方法论就是既然世界这么不均匀，我们就不应该“公平”对待世界上的各种东西。
>
巴菲特说我这辈子挣得绝大多数钱，都是来自少于十个决定。
>
做事最关键的战略，就是做好最关键的。
>
不管是当初做 Mac 还是现在做 iPad，乔布斯的做法一贯都是首先用一个小的精英团队秘密开发核心功能[6]。选拔年轻的天才，激励他们每周工作90个小时，只专注于最关键的部分，把细节留给将来让大团队去慢慢补充。
>
iPhone出来一鸣惊人，但是连最起码的复制粘贴功能都不给，而iPad一出来居然不支持多任务工作。也许市场上的每一个智能手机都有复制粘贴功能，每一台电脑都能多任务，可它们全都没法跟苹果的产品相提并论 — 因为iPhone和iPad上能做其他所有产品都做不到的事。乔布斯不追求大而全，而是先把最有核心竞争力的东西做出来，因为他知道这才是消费者最关心的东西。

How to realize this principle?

>80/20法则告诉我们应该怎么做事呢？应该追求只做“重要而不紧急”的事！
>
这就是现在很多人谈论的所谓“极简主义”的生活哲学。整天被一些所谓紧急的小事推着走，疲于奔命，这种生活最没效率。一个忙于琐事的CEO不会对公司长远发展有什么洞见，一个被老板支来支去的员工干不了什么大事，一个永远准备下一次考试的学生成不了什么大器。
>
要事优先，尽量只做最重要的事，少干或者不干那些不重要的事，才是出类拔萃的关键。
>
要事优先，第一你得有自由意志，知道自己有选择的权力，不能别人让你做什么就做什么，强调主动性。第二你得学会判断哪些重要哪些不重要。第三你还得有勇气有能力拒绝自己不想干的事，敢跟人说“不”。
>
比如读新闻，你可能觉得这个也重要，那个也必读，订阅了一大堆公众号，在微博上关注一大堆人，每天被江湖风云牵着走，实际上大都是没有用的。你应该有所侧重，勇于删除和忽略不重要的信息。正确做法是以我为主，变被动为主动，在一段时间内对某一方面的内容下功夫研究透彻。

about how to raise child?

>人的精力有限，什么都想要是不可能的。如果真想培养人才，“全面”发展其实是一个错误的思想，天赋树不能乱点。极简主义要求我们培养核心的竞争力，在他喜欢的东西上加大力度。用20%的时间就可能实现这个小孩80%的功能，剩下80%的时间几乎都是浪费，还不如让他去玩。
>
玩很重要。极简主义的核心思想就是把最关键的事情做好，省出来时间去玩。这也符合特勒布在《反脆弱》一书说的“杠铃原则”：做事要注重两端不管中间 — 我要么做最难的事，要么玩或者什么都不做。
>
我没时间做简单的事。

[张佳玮：财富自由意味着什么](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA5NjY2NTcxOA==&mid=402236164&idx=1&sn=1fb983a2ba7edaa3fe3103792dfb5643)

about financial independence

>财富自由，也就是财富独立。
>
维基如是说：
>
Financial independence is generally used to describe the state of having sufficient personal wealth to live, without having to work actively for basic necessities.
For financially independent people, their assets generate income that is greater than their expenses.
>
简单说，被动收入>支出，就算是财富自由了。

the key point is the income generated by assets! Not salary! In other words, this is the money we can get when we don't work!

[The art of learning,C0 introduction](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ap4oQsSlxvRLiYHPDm3y3gorV8TgZ97xGmA)

amazing thing of Tai chi

>I remember one time, in the middle of a sparring session I sensed a hole in my partner's structure and suddenly he seemed to leap away from me. He looked shocked and told me that he had been pushed away, but he hadn't noticed any explosive movement on my part. I had no idea what to make of this, but slowly I began to realise the martial power of my living room meditation sessions. After thousands of slow-motion, ever-refined repetitions of certain movements, my body could become that shape instinctively. Somehow in Tai Chi the mind needed little physical action to have great physical effect.
>
This type of learning experience was familiar to me from chess. **My whole life I had studied techniques, principles, and theory until they were integrated into the unconscious.**

amazing thing about connections between different things

>I remember sitting on a Bermuda cliff one stormy afternoon, watching waves pound into the rocks. I was focused on the water trickling back out to sea and suddenly knew the answer to a chess problem I had been wrestling with for weeks. Another time, after completely immersing myself in the analysis of a chess position for eight hours, I had a breakthrough in my Tai Chi and successfully tested it in class that night.

Please give heed to this kind of words: focused on, completely immersing myself in, these are the key of learning!

how to teach, do not give information/answer directly

>Bruce did not want to feed me information, but to help my mind carve itself into maturity.

it is different for talent and passion, I guess the guys playing chess in part are those who really love chess. They like the chess itself so that they will enjoy the feeling in the adversity. But some one like myself, just like the feeling of winning, if not so smoothly, I will give up easily.

>My friends in Washington Square were valiant competitors, you could never count them out-in fact they were most dangerous when on the ropes. Many very talented kids expected to win without much resistance. When the game was a struggle, they were emotionally unprepared.

[The Attention Revolution: Unlocking the Power of the Focused Mind]

why people fear solitude? Because their minds are seriously imbalanced, so no distractions, and no escape!
